Question 1 
This question consists of multiple CSV files (In the Zipped Folder) with 'large texts' in one of the columns in each file. Your job is to use the open-source NLP (Natural Language Processing) libraries and perform various tasks. 

Task 1: 
Extract the 'text' in all the CSV files and store them into a single '.txt file'.

First: How to write data from a CSV file to a text file using Python?

CSV File: Is a file where data is stored in a table format, where each value is separated by a comma  


 (e.g., "name, age, city").


Text File: A simple file that can contain any text.

Ok, Let's Walk Through This with Simple Steps and Explanations
1. What we want to do
Imagine you have a file called input_file.csv that looks like this:

name, age, city
John,25, New York
Alice,30, Sydney
Bob,22, Melbourne


We want to take this file and copy its contents into another file, called output_file.txt.
2. Explaining the Steps in Plain Language
Here's what we will do using the most straightforward words:
1. Open the "input" file (the CSV file) to read it.
2. Open the "output" file (the text file) to write into it.
3. Copy each line from the CSV file and paste it into the text file.
4. Save and close both files.
This is what the code looks like, with comments that explain each line in simple terms:

Simplifying the Code Explanation
* open('input_file.csv', 'r'): Think of this as opening a book to read.
* open('output_file.txt', 'w'): This is like opening a notebook to write something new.
* for line in csv_file:: This is like turning each page in the book one by one.
* text_file.write(line): It's like copying what you read on each page and writing it in your notebook.
Closing the Files: Always "close the book" when you're done. This saves everything you've written.

Before Running the Code
1. Save this code: Copy the code into a simple text editor (like Notepad) and save it with the name copy_csv.py.
2. Make sure that your CSV file (input_file.csv) is in the same folder as the Python script (copy_csv.py).
Run the Code: In the terminal, go to the folder where your script is saved and type:                                             python copy_csv.py

After running, you should find an output_file.txt with the same content as the CSV file.
Even Simpler Words
This code is like copying a list from one notebook (CSV) to another notebook (text file) line by line. You open both notebooks, copy each line, and then close them. That's it!
Does this explanation help clarify things? We can walk through it again if needed! ??


Another example:

 This is the code:  csv_file = open ( 'input_file.csv', 'r') 

You can absolutely change the name of the file to whatever you like! The name inside the open() function should match the name of your actual file.
So, if your file is named Rhemessa_file.csv or input_Rhemessa.csv, you can modify the code like this:

# Step 1: Open the CSV file so we can read its content
csv_file = open('Rhemessa_file.csv', 'r')  # 'r' means we're opening it to read

OR

# Step 1: Open the CSV file so we can read its content
csv_file = open('input_Rhemessa.csv', 'r')  # 'r' means we're opening it to read

Just make sure that the file name you use in the code is exactly the same as the file you have on your computer, including the .csv part.
