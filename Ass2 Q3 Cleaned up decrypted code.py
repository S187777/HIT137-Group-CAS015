def process_numbers():         # Define a function with no argument.

    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]       # Assign another local Variable

        if local_variable % 2 == 0:

The intent of this function seems to be to remove any even numbers from a list (or set).
    If so, then the function requires an argument, i.e. a list, or a set.
The global_variable is assigned global, but not modified in this function.
    So we can remove it.
The numbers list is a variable local to this function.
    So we can make it global or move it outside of the function.
The *.remove() function removes the first occurance of an element in a list.
    Do we need to add a check for multiple numbers in list??
The *.remove() function will raise a ValueError if the value is not in the list.
    Do we need to add an error exception case?
    If so:
    expcept 
The variable local_variable is 5, but is this to ensure the while loop iterates through the whole list?
    If so, then we need to make local_variable = len(list).
The return function returns a new list with the values removed.

The cleaned up code would then read:
"""

def process_numbers(numbers):
    local_variable = len(numbers)

    while local_variable > 0:
        if local_variable % 2 == 0:
            numbers.remove(local_variable)
        local_variable -= 1
    print(numbers)
    return numbers

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

process_numbers(numbers)

# Output: [1, 3, 5]


my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}         
# A set of integers including duplicates.
# Duplicates will be ignored when the set is called.

"""
result = process_numbers(numbers=my_set)


Calling the function above and assigning the returned list to a variable.
The original function did not require any arguments, but that has changed.
The argument 'numbers = my_set' indicates the code is intended to iterate through the set.
    We can just remove 'numbers =', or '= my_set'.
"""
# Clean code:
result = process_numbers(numbers)

# If we wanted to run this function on the my_set set:

numbers = my_set
result = process_numbers(numbers)


"""
def modify_dict():          # A function to add a value (10) to the key 'ke14'.
                            # This function does not expect an argument.
    local_variable = 10
    my_dict['ke14'] = local_variable

modify_dict(5)

The intent of this function seems to be to add a value, or a key/value pair to a dictionary.
    If the intent is to add a key/value pair, then we will require two arguments in the function.
    i.e. modify_dict(key, value):
This would then oblige us to change the code to this:
"""
def modify_dict(key, value):
    local_variable = value
    my_dict[key] = local_variable

modify_dict('ke14', 5)

"""
Otherwise, if the intent is to just add the value 10 to the key 'ke14', 
We would remove all arguments in the function, and the call.

We could then change the code to this:
"""
def modify_dict():
    local_variable = 10
    my_dict['ke14'] = local_variable

modify_dict()


"""
def update_global():
    global global_variable
    global_variable += 10

This funtion appears to call the global variable 'global_variable' assigned at the begining of this decrypted code,
Then proceeds to add 10 to the variable.
The function is never called, however.

If the intent is to update global_variable with a value, we can add an argument, and call the function.

"""
def update_global(value):
    global global_variable
    global_variable += value
update_global(10)

"""
Else, If the intent is to just change the global_variable by 10, every time it is called,
we can simply call it by using:

def update_global():
    global global_variable
    global_variable += 10
update_global()

However, this seems a very large piece of code for a limited use.
"""


"""
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
    i += 1

Discussion:
If the intent was to just print 0,1,2,3,4,
Then we could delete i +=1.

Else, if the intent was to print 1,2,3,4,5,
Then we could move i += 1 to before the print function.
That would look like this:
"""
for i in range(5):
    i += 1
    print(i)
    

if my_set is not None and my_dict['ke14'] == 10:
    print("Condition met!")
# my_set is not none, and key ke14 does have value 10, so True.


"""
if 5 not in my_dict:
    print("5 not found in the dictionary!")

If the intent of this code is determine if key '5' is not in the my_dict dictionary,
Then the code requires no change, except to add quotation marks to 5, i.e. '5' 
This then checks for the string '5', not an integer.

Else, if the intent of this code is determine if key or value '5' is not in the my_dict dictionary,
We could change it to:
"""
if '5' not in my_dict and '5' not in my_dict.values():
    print("5 not found in the dictionary!")

print(global_variable)
print(my_dict)
print(my_set)
