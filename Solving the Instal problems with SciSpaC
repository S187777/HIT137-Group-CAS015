Solving the Instal problems with SciSpaCy

Just a heads up.... I felt like an idiot for not being able to install 
SciSpaCy..... but it wasnt my fault....
 
Spacy installs without any problems, BUT.... 
SciSpaCy wont pip install unless you do so in an environment 
using python 3.8 (or older), because it relies on nmslib, 
which wont install on anything higher...
