hospitalization pt was put on CIWA scale for EtOH withdrawal and given thiamine folate and a multivitamin his AFib with RVR was initially treated with metoprolol then diltiazem his high ammonia levels were treated with lactulose His b l ankle fractures were followed by orthopedics The patient was severely agitated on more than one occassion during this hospitalization requiring three codes puples to be called as well as requiring restraints for protection of both the patient and the staff The patient was originally sent from the floor to the MICU with delirium of unknown cause and severe agititation He required increased amounts of sedation and was returned to the floor after a NG tube was placed Once returned to the floor the patient required less sedation was taken off of any benzodiazipines and only intermittently needed restraints The patient remained somnolent and delerious He pulled out his NG tube He was also febrile and rhoncorous on the floor He was initially treated with vancomycin and flagyl which was changed to azithro ceftriaxone flagyl He was scheduled to return to the OR for revision of his right external fixation In preop holding he was found to be hypoxic and sent to the MICU MICU COURSE Morning of patient scheduled to return to OR for revision of externally fixated RLE Upon transport to PACU patient became more somnolent and had reported agonal breathing O sats on LNC and NRB applied with O sats to BP in s s HR in s RR ABG drawn During stay in MICU patient coughed up large amount of thick sputum with improved respiratory status Surgery postponed and patient transferred to MICU for further monitoring In the MICU respiratory status has remained stable with Sp in the high s on room air Pt is hemodynamically stable in chronic a flutter Called out to floor on no further intensive care needs identified In the MICU patient was started on Zosyn and restarted on Vancomycin wiht marked improvement in his respiratory status Within a few days of returning to the floor Vancomycin and zosyn were stopped as CXR showed resolution of questionable aspiration pneumonia this was felt to be more likely pneuomonitis which resolved After the MICU patient s delirium started to improve but then worsened when he returned to the OR for removal of external fixation He developed fevers to F post operatively which likely worsened delirium Source of fevers unclear of note patient had recently developed VRE in his urine but infectious disease did not feel this was an active infection he received three days of antibiotics daptomycin and then linezolid When these were stopped he became afebrile and delirium began to lift Aggitation was mostly controlled with haldol Zyprexa was tried for two weeks but it did not seem to help acute aggitation QTc was monitored while patient was on antipsychotics and was stable at approximately msec Overall etiology of delirium has remained unclear but was thought to be multifactorial due in part to chronic alcohol use hepatic encephalopathy benzodiazepine use and post operative delririum Although spanish speaking sitters and interpreters were employed as much as possible language also likely contributed to persistance of delirium Delirium has completely resolved patient is now restraint and sitter free All haldol has been stopped He has past the period of etoh withdrawal It is recommended that patient follow up with alcohol abuse counseling Afib flutter While febrile his afib flutter was complicated by more frequent episodes of rapid ventricular rate This was controlled with IV metoprolol when needed but also by increasing PO metoprolol and diltiazem Treating fever with tylenol also seemed to help He was briefly put on therapeutic lovenox for atrial fibrillation but this was stopped as he was not felt to be eligible by CHADS criteria and also because of high fall risk Patient was transitioned off of beta blockers and placed on Diltiazem mg daily Urinary retention patient failed several voiding trials He also pulled out his foley on several occasions causing hematuria Intermittent straight catheterization was tried to reduce infection risk of long term indwelling foley However given delirium and aggitation this was untenable This resolved with reductions in haldol Patient now able to void freely on his own History of VRE on urine culture but no signs of infection dyruria increased urinary frequency There is no evidence based literature or other clinical indications to treat this asymptomatic bacteuria at this time Fractures patient followed by orthopedics during admission L ankle fractures treated with casting however repeat plain films and CT scan weeks post op showed fractures which were not initially visualized Orthopedics felt casting was still appropriate and that there was no indication for surgery R pilon fracture managed initially with external fixation system because of skin breakdown making internal fixation difficult One month into

effusion HOSPITAL COURSE A year old male with no past medical history originally admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with hypoxia bilateral pneumonia received Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin and then Doxycycline was added since he had a parakeet at home he also has rats at home He underwent a bronchoscopy and had a computed tomographic angiography of the thorax which demonstrated right middle lobe and right lower lobe pulmonary emboli with a question of infarction He was subsequently heparinized His human immunodeficiency virus test was negative He received Bactrim and steroids for a few days but were stopped when his human immunodeficiency virus test came back negative A hypercoagulability workup was pending when he arrived on the floor in stable condition On arrival to the floor he was clinically improving on the heparin drip Ceftriaxone Azithromycin and Doxycycline The further studies that were obtained while in the Intensive Care Unit included First Name NamePattern Doctor First Name which was negative an ANCA which was negative hepatitis panel which was negative LENIS demonstrated no deep vein thrombosis a thrombosis of the right lesser saphenous vein echocardiogram was obtained as well on that demonstrated an ejection fraction of a mildly dilated right ventricle and mild tricuspid regurgitation The chest computerized tomography scan mentioned above was on and that demonstrated multiple small pulmonary emboli right lower lobe and right middle lobe and bilateral atypical pneumonias Workup for the organism of said pneumonia was undertaken He had negative viral culture negative Chlamydia negative leptospirosis negative C Psittaci and negative mycoplasmas Blood cultures were negative as well He was maintained on Azithromycin and completed a day course for his pneumonia The Doxycycline was withdrawn He completed a ten day course of Ceftriaxone Regarding the pulmonary emboli he remained hemodynamically stable on a heparin drip throughout his admission A repeat computerized tomography scan of the thorax demonstrated bilateral expanded heterogenous soft tissue densities within the rectus abdominis muscle hematomas partial resolution of bilateral perihilar ground glass opacities left SVC however no pulmonary emboli Given the discrepancy between the and computerized tomography scans it would be very difficult to prove that there were no pulmonary emboli on the film The decision to anticoagulate him for three to six months and then to pursue further evaluation was made Regarding his anticoagulation workup the patient had a positive anticardiolipin IgM This is an intermediate range value The IgG anticardiolipin value was The patient had a normal PTT on admission While we can not make the diagnosis of anticardiolipin syndrome on a single value the finding stands as nonspecific however the anticardiolipin panel will have to be repeated in six weeks The patient was subsequently continued on anticoagulation for pulmonary emboli His heparin drip was discontinued by discharge where he was bridged to Coumadin with Lovenox Regarding the rectus hematomas noted on computerized axial tomography scan this finding is commonly seen in the setting of anticoagulation The patient concurrently had fevers maximally to degrees F There was concern perhaps the fevers may be attributable to the hematoma or a local infection thereabouts He was started on Clindamycin in conjunction with the Infectious Disease Consult Service s recommendations He completed a ten day course of Clindamycin Finally the patient was noted to have a drop in his hematocrit during his anticoagulation He was guaiac negative There was no other source for bleed identified It is likely he bled into the abdominal hematoma attributing for the drop in hematocrit The patient was also intermittently hyponatremic during his stay likely secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secondary to the thoracic processes namely bilateral pneumonia pulmonary embolisms on this admission DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS Bilobar pneumonia with atypical fevers Pulmonary embolus Rectus hematoma Anticardiolipin antibody IgM positive Hyponatremia Anemia FOLLOW UP The patient will follow up with his primary provider Last Name NamePattern First Name NamePattern Last Name NamePattern the week following discharge MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE He will be discharged on Lovenox

recommended Brief Hospital Course y o M presenting after syncopal episode found to have multiple small ICH and new pancytopenia Had complicated course of AMPL treatment Leukemia Patient found to have AMPL via bone marrow biopsy the day of admission to the MICU He was started on ATRA and monitored closely for symptoms of DIC TLS and ATRA syndrome He was transfused as needed with PRBC platlets and FFP He did not develop overt signs of DIC He was induced with Ara c and daunurubicin His counts responded appropriatly A repeat BM biopsy showed remission and he will continue the ATRA for now and follow up with Dr Last Name STitle for plans of stage two of his treatment Fevers He initially was on Vancomycin and cefepime when first starting treatment due to a hx of fevers at home but as his culture data was negative and he remained afebrile his antibiotics were discontinued He remained afebrile until when he spiked a fever He was cultured and his blood grew strep viridans He was started on vanco cefepime at that time He also had a headache the day he spiked and a CT was done showing what appeared to be brain abscesses His antibiotics were eventually broadened to vanco meropenem fluconzaole and flagyl for the brain abscesses He continued to spike though for approximately a week He complained of some thigh pain and we did an ultrasound showing bilateral fluid collections They were drained in IR and grew MSSA He then developed a pneumonia during his febrile period and was transferred to the ICU for several days He required O for a while after being discharged from the ICU While in the ICU his neutrophil count started to drop and it was worried that he might be having a drug effect His vanco was discontinued and his counts began to recover Eventually he was on meropenem voriconazole and acyclovir and stopped having fevers A repeat CT scan showed resolution of his PNA Serial repeat head CTs showed slow decrease in size of his abscesses And an MRI of his thigh showed retained small fluid collections bilaterally The plan is to complete week course of the above antibiotics for his brain abscesses We will reimage his thighs with an MRI as an outpatient and depending on those results he will either need surgical drainage or still prolonged course of abx He will follow up with ID ICH Pt with multiple small ICH sustained from fall with acute left sided head injury in the setting of profound thrombocytopenia CT head revealed small foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage no hydrocephalus or shift On follow up Head CT revealed interval increase in hemorrhage but without appreciable midline shift or infarction The pt s neurologic exam remained stable Neurosurgery followed closely Platlet goal was K A repeat head CT one month after a fall showed the brain abscesses that were discussed above Neuro onc was consulted and followed along It was decided not to do a biopsy He also required heparin and then lovenox for DVTs and repeat head CTs while on these anticoaulants remained stable and without new bleeds Thigh pain weakness Etiology unclear and unable to get good exam as limited by pain This may be bone marrow pain No evidence of hematoma or cellulitis No bowel or bladder dysfunction no saddle anesthesia no focal spinal tenderness to indicate acute cord compression MRI or the T L spine revealed no evidence of acute cord compression There was evidence of layering fluid likely from the SAH Although unlikely to be causing the pt s leg pain nerve irritation secondary to blood Neurosurgery recommended starting Decadron on He was not kept on decadron because chemotherapy was initiated Eventually he was found to have abscesses in his thighs as discussed above Afib pt went into afib while in the ICU His blood pressures remained stable and he was started on metoprolol His high rates were s s he contined to have afib on and off for about a week and then remained in NSR the week prior to discharge His metoprolol was titrated to mg tid for good rate control Name NI pt had one episode of b Name NI v afib with aberrancy Cards was consulted and we did agressive electrolyte repletion and continued the metoprolol He did not have any more occurrences Vasovagal bradycardia the day prior to admission while the patient was having a bowel movement he was noted on telemetry to brady to the s he felt light headed and it resolved in minutes Appeared to be vaso vagal and he did not have any more occurrences Again cards was consulted and they recommended leaving the metoprolol dose the same at mg tid as bb actually helps prevent vagal episodes DVTs while patient was in the ICU he developed bilaterally pedal edema thought initially to be due to large amount of IVFs Because of his new afib though we did ultrasounds and found him to have DVTs in R leg R arm because he was edematous and had pain around a new PICC line Heparin was started overnight but because of his hx of ICHs it was decided to stop the heparin and place an IVC filter It was put in place without complications Evenutally he was found to have bilaterally leg DVTs and then bilateral upper extremity DVTs At that point it was decided that he should be anticoagulated Heparin was initially Repeat head CT showed no bleed And then he was converted to lovenox for outpatient treatment of the DVTs He also had a VQ scan during these findings of DVT that showed low prob of PE Access pt initially had a subclavian line then it was pulled while the patient was febrile in early Month only He had PIVs until transfer to the ICU when a PICC line was placed The PICC line was removed after a DVT was found in the arm He again had PIVs for a while until a IR guided subclavian line was placed For outpatient continuation of his week course of antibiotics a hickman was placed as PICCs could not be placed due to bilateraly UE DVTs Pt was discharged walking around passing PT and going up stairs He respiratory status was much

small areas of bleeding in your head that were stable based on repeat CT scans You received chemotherapy for your leukemia While you were here you developed an infection both in your brain around the areas where the inital bleeds were found as well as in your thighs We treated you with antibiotics which you will need to continue after going home You also developed blood clots in your arms and legs We place a filter in your inferior vena cave a large vein in your abdomen so the clots would not go to your lungs We also anticoagulated you with heparin You can go home on lovenox to stay anticoagulated Lastly you developed a heart arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation For that you should continue taking the medicine metoprolol You will have a home nurse help you and your wife do antibiotics and the lovenox shots You should make sure to start returning to work very slowly It is probably best to not work or work from home the first week and see how you are feeling before

failure LVEF CAD s p CABG PTCA STEMI with BMS to the SVG OM graft presents with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion found to have hematocrit drop secondary to GI bleed ACTIVE DIAGNOSES Chest Pain Demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed He has known coronary vascular disease with refractory angina that is not amenable to intervention per cardiology team No evidence of consolidation or PTX on CXR to suggest pulmonary cause Patient was transfused a total of units pRBCs hematocrit initially stabilized and when heparin gtt and coumadin were re started hematocrit dropped again and chest pain returned without EKG changes He was continued on aspirin plavix and ranolazine Imdur was started at a lower dose than home dose given concern for hypotension in setting of bleeding but BP remained stable so imdur was titrated up to his home dose He then had return of chest pain with dynamic ST changes in V V and I avL consistent with known non intervenable areas of disease His imdur was increased to mg and metoprolol was increased to tartrate mg PO BID without further episodes of chest pain UGIB H Pylori Nodular Gastritis On EGD patient had evidence of nodular gastritis with superficial erosions H pylori returned positive and patient began triple therapy with amoxicillin not candidate for clarithromycin given interaction with ranolazine metronidazole and pantoprazole Coumadin was held and INR was reversed with vitamin K Patient had ongoing hematocrit drop without obvious bleeding once heparin drip was restarted so both coumadin and heparin were stopped Patient will complete weeks of triple therapy then continue Hospital pantoprazole He does not require GI follow up or test of cure He also underwent colonoscopy which did not reveal an additional or alternative source of his bleeding If he continues to bleed the next step would be a capsule endoscopy He will have a Hospital check prior to his PCP appointment to assess his hematocrit Acute blood loss anemia Source suspected to be gastritis as above Coumadin was held on admission to the ICU and reversed with vitamin K and FFP He was transfused a total of units during admission initially units in the ICU as he had an inappropriate response to blood then again on the floor as with initiation of coumadin and bridge with heparin drip patient s hematocrit drifted down Haptoglobin and LDH were normal and indirect bilirubin was only slightly elevated and was post transfusion so low suspicion for hemolysis With discontinuation of heparin drip and coumadin hematocrit stabilized and patient did not require transfusion for hours prior to discharge Constipation Significantly constipated during admission Required days of prep prior to his colonoscopy Patient discharged on senna colace miralax to prevent further constipation Acute on chronic systolic heart failure On admission patient had mild pulmonary edema secondary to decreased lasix and spironolactone dose over past week prior to admission Patient was diuresed in the ICU and was euvolemic on transfer to the floor He was continued on home lasix mg daily with extra doses with transfusions He had a few episodes of orthostatic hypotension prompting decrease of his lasix dose to mg PO daily Patient was euvolemic at the time of discharge and weight was stable at kg Hyperkalemia on admission likely secondary to ARF spironolactone and lisinopril ECG improved to narrow complex once potassium normalized Potassium remained stable for remainder of admission Spironolactone was not restarted and lisinopril was restarted at lower dose of mg PO daily LBBB Suspect metabolic etiology given improved with K correction Trop negative suggesting against acute coronary syndrome LBBB resolved after correction of K Acute renal failure Likely secondary to systolic CHF with poor forward flow with second hit of poor perfusion due to acute GIB Patient s creatinine trended down and was on day of discharge Leukocytosis Unclear etiology but may be due to stress of GIB No evidence of infectious colitis UA without evidence of infection and no consolidation seen on CXR White count resolved and remained normal for remainder of admission CHRONIC

Renal US Mildly echogenic but otherwise normal appearing kidneys may be secondary to medical renal disease x cm echogenic focus in the left kidney may represent a cholesterol deposit versus a

was intubated for repiratory failure and treated for a possible pneumonia She was not able to tolerate weaning off the ventilator and therefore required tracheostomy for longer term ventilator support While awaiting trach placement Ms Known lastname also developed a ventilator associated pneumonia She grew MRSA in her sputum and blood and was treated with a course of vancomycin Zosyn was added after days of vancomycin as she had repeated L lung collapse with thick mucous plugging and we wanted to cover for pneumonia as well Subsequent surveillance cultures were clean Zosyn was later switched to Cefepime worsening renal failure attributed to Zosyn She completed an day course of antibiotics Her tracheostomy went well and she was started on an in exsufflator as well to aid in clearing her secretions mucous to prevent recurrent lung colapse A fib Ms Known lastname had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR all in the setting of L lung collapse She was initially started on a beta blocker with good response After having multiple episodes she was started on amiodarone and anticoagulation with heparin In all cases she converted to sinus rhythm on her own Shortly after starting heparin she had an episode of guaiac positive stool and then a small amount of melena Her heparin was stopped and was not restarted as she remained in sinus rhythm and the concern was that her risk of GI bleeding is higher than her risk of stroke Her PEG was lavaged and was OB negative She will also need a colonoscopy as an outpatient to further evaluate the cause of her melena She has subtle ST changes on inital EKG but ruled out for an MI by enzymes hypotension Ms Known lastname was hypotensive on intial presentation responding well to fluid boluses She had a cortisol stimulation test with normal response It became clear that she responds to sedation with benzodiazepines with prolonged hypotension as well as increased delerium and agitation and therefore these were stopped and put into her allergy list After cessation of benzodiazepines her blood pressure was much more stable and she did not require bolusing She never required pressors ALS It was felt that she likely had progression of her ALS with diaphragmatic weakness and CO retention Her respiratory mechanics were repeatedly asessed and showed that she would not be able to come off the vent Therefore a trach was placed in the OR by thoracic surgery IP unable to place due to her anatomy hyponatremia Mrs Known lastname was hyponatremic on admission Tis resolved with hydration indicating that she was

Hypernatremia Likely releated to low volume WIll increase free water with tube feeds from cc q hr to cc q h A chenistry panel should be checked on to make sure Na remains stable conjunctivitis Ms Known lastname had bilateral conjunctivitis on admission This resolved with a day course of erythromycin eye cream skin changes Ms Known lastname intitial presenting chief complaint was erythema of her hands and feet Dermatology was consulted and said that she likely has erythromyalgia The treatment for this is sarna lotion and aspirin and improvement does not occur in less than a month She was treated with sarna and ASA throughout her stay Additionally she had burns on the inside of both thighs from a hot tea spill at home prior to admission Per dermatology recs these areas were treated with antibiotic cream and xeroform dressings and healed over cleanly without infection FEN Ms Known lastname had a PEG on admission as she has not been able to take PO intake for some time secondary to progression of her ALS She was continued NPO with tubefeeds per nutrition We monitored repleted her electrolytes lytes She was kept euvolemic Renal Failure Pt s Creatinine increased during this

was felt that her symptoms developed from her underlying pneumonia and an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation that caused pulmonary edema She was diuresed with good effect with IV furosemide and a two gram sodium diet Her antibiotic coverage was transitioned from levofloxacin to azithromycin Urine and blood cultures failed to grow anything and she was initially febrile early in the hospital course despite antibiotic treament She was however afebrile during the forty eight hours prior to discharge on azithromycin She continued to cough intermittently but this was well controlled with benzonatate Hypotension Occuring in the ED and resolving by the time she reached the MICU her hypotension although originally felt due to septic physiology was ultimately thought to be secondary to overdiuresis and anti hypertensive therapy while in the ED Once her fluid status and heart rate were optimized she remained normotensive for the rest of the admission PAF She was continued on her

MR small secundum ASD with left to right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest She appeared clinically fluid overloaded without hypoxia with BNP Pt had complex course on the medicine floor with multiple episodes of worsening resp status thought due to flash pulm edema Initially her symptoms responded to lasix and additional BP control However the renal function slowly worsened and she had a decreasing response to diuresis Pt became progressively uremic and confused on with mild respiratory distress She was transferred to the CCU on and received mg Lasix IV bolus followed by gtt She was aggressively diuresed per renal recs started on Lasix mg PO BID She has had good volume output with the lasix Patient has been in good volume status since has not had any further episodes of flash

baseline Cr of until Month only when baseline increased to On this admission patient had worsening renal function with creatinine rising from to It was unclear whether the patient s increasing creatinine was due to dehydration vs volume overload particularly given her recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema and CXR showing evidence of fluid overload She was aggressively diuresed in the CCU and her volume status has been stable on mg of PO lasix Hospital Patient and family have decided to decline hemodialysis and focus more on comfort measures Renal Artery Stenosis Patient with atrophic right kidney left renal artery stenosis Very likely that this is the reason that she is very difficult to diurese and the reason why she flashes easily She was originally planned for renal artery stenting but the procedure was held off because she was unstable requiring CCU transfer Goals of care were discussed with patient and renal stenting was tabled as patient decided against aggressive management and to focus more on comfort Body Pain Patient describes body pain since waking up in the morning of her admission Unclear etiology but likely viral symptoms vs non specific findings CHF exacerbation Infectious workup was negative Leukocytosis resolved on discharge Patient has had transient episodes of chest pain on this admission which was reproducible with palpation and

who developed a large abdominal wall hematoma in the context of enoxaparin injections Multifocal Pneumonia She was admitted with multifocal pneumonia She was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin She completed a day course of levofloxacin MRSA was found to grow in her sputum so she was continued on a day course of vancomycin She originally presented with elevated WBC count and left shift which quickly resolved with the initiation of antibiotics Her productive cough improved as well and she remained on her baseline home O of L Approximately days after completion of her day course of Vancomycin the patient developed worsening cough SOB and upper respiratory symptoms A repeat CXR showed evidence of a new consolidation in the RLL The patient was started back on Levofloxacin Flagyl Vancomycin was added to her regimen when blood cultures showed bottles with GPC in clusters and chains Additionally her sputum culture grew out GNRs Levofloxacin was discontinued and Meropenem was started for concern for Pseudomonas given the patient s long hospital course Her O sat remained stable on L nasal cannula which is her baseline She was given mucomyst inhaled nebulizers to assist in breaking up thick sputum Her GNRs in the sputum grew out E coli Because of the sensitivity profile of the E coli and the patient s allergy to penicillin and cephalosporins the patient was continued on Meropenem Her GPCs were found to grow out Coag negative Staph Surveillance cultures had no further growth and the coag negative staph was thought to likely be a contaminant Her Vancomycin was discontinued She will continue a day course of Meropenem and she was discharged with a PICC to complete this course Pulmonary embolism DVTs She has had multiple PEs and has had one even since the placement of a TrapEase IVC filter CT during recent previous hospitalization revealed appropriate location of filter and CTA on this admission showed improvement of clot Admission labwork revealed an INR of Coumadin was thus held and reversed with FFP and vitamin K given her history of GIB on anticoagulation In the interim therapeutic lovenox injections were initiated but within days of starting she developed a large abdominal wall hematoma near to lovenox injection site Once her hematocrit stabilized she was started on a heparin gtt with coumadin overlap While Last Name NamePattern her Coumadin with an INR she was found to have a large Hct drop and a CT scan of the abdomen showed a new rectus hematoma She was subsequently transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring It was decided after her second hematoma while on anticoagulation the risks of anticoagulation outweigh the benefits at this time and she was not anticoagulated In terms of her hypercoagulable workup it has been negative thus far for hyperhomocysteinemia Factor V Leiden and antiphospholipid antibody Malignancy workup included a colonoscopy and EGD as well as CEA all of which were within normal limits SPEP revealed hypogammaglobulinemia but was otherwise unremarkable During her hospital course she also began to complain of worsening lower extremity pain LENIs were obtained which showed evidence of extensive completely occlusive bilateral deep venous thrombi extending from the common femoral veins to the popliteal veins Radiology felt that these clots were most likely acute to subacute in nature In this setting hematology oncology saw the patient again to consider the risks vs benefits of anticoagulation Antithrombin III prothrombin mutation Lupus anticoagulation and Location un Venom Viper were sent to reevaluate the reason for her hypercoagulability The hematology oncology team still felt that the risks of coagulation outweigh the potential benefits given that the patient has had multiple bleeding episodes in the setting of anticoagulation Abdominal wall hematoma As mentioned above she developed a large left sided abdominal wall hematoma from a Lovenox injection site that caused a significant hct drop originally Despite the drop she remained hemodynamically stable has sinus tachycardia at baseline prior to bleed She received units prbcs units FFP Her hematocrit then stabilized and once stable she was restarted on heparin gtt Coumadin was re initiated and heparin gtt was continued while awaiting her INR to become therapeutic While Location un her Coumadin with an INR she was found to have another Hct drop and a CT scan of the abdomen showed a new right sided rectus hematoma She was subsequently transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring She was given unit FFP and units PRBCs between Date range until her hematocrit became stable and she bumped appropriately to transfusion It was decided after her second hematoma while on anticoagulation the risks of anticoagulation outweigh the benefits at this time and she was not anticoagulated She has complained of abdominal pain with movement and has maintained stable hematocrits Her pain is most likely to the large rectus hematoma that will resolve over time Her Hct remained stable after her anticoagulation was discontinued Thoracic mass CT chest and abdomen revealed a stable thoracic mass stable x years and thought potentially consistent with neural cyst It was not further evaluated by MRI given its long term stability and also she has metal hardware in place s p elbow surgery and facial plates It should be followed up with imaging to ensure it remains unchanged in the future Zoster Patient reports having a history of herpes on her right buttock During her stay she developed a tingling

was discovered that his left sided was secondary to a right sided thalmocapsular hemorrhage In the ICU he remained hemodynamically stable however his neurological exam worsened from left sided hemiparesis to essentially hemiplegia involving most of his left side including face arm and leg The differential included hypertensive hemorrhage mass aneurysm or hemorrhagic conversion of an embolic As the patient had little recorded or reportable medical history it is unclear that he had a history of HTN but this was clearly the most likely diagnosis as no mass was observed and the MRA was negtive for vascular malformation He was quite hypertensive at admission with BPs s requiring IV hydralazine for control The patient had a deterioration in his mental status after transfer out of the ICU An encephalopathy work up revealed bilateral pleural effusions thought to be secondary to possible aspiration pneumonia His antibiotic regimen was changed to Levofloxacin and Metronidazole and he became alert and oriented within hrs He should complete another days of Levofloxacin and Flagyl Physical therapy has been involved with his care and he has been moved to and from his bed to a chair

yo male admitted after motorcycle accident and found to have inferior STEMI who underwent emergent cardiac cath with BMS to distal RCA STEMI Patient brought to CCU s p emergent cardiac cath for inferior STEMI which revealed a proximal stenosis of the RCA as well as a distal stenosis that was thrombotic and ulcerated Patient had BMS placed in distal RCA There was evidence of right ventricular ischemia infarction Of note patient had no previously known h o CAD but his urine tox screen was positive for cocaine on presentation The patient later denied any recent cocaine use A TTE obtained the next day revealed moderate regional biventricular systolic dysfunction c w RCA territory infarction and RV infarction mild mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension The patient developed ventricular bradycardia and hypotension and Swan that was placed showed elevated pressures in RA RV LA WP indicating biventricular failure Repeat cath the following day showed thrombosis of RCA stent and a decision was made to medically manage the patient as at this point microvascular perfusion was severely impaired by distal embolization and clot formation Post cath he was gravely ill with acute systolic CHF and right ventricular failure He had an IABP placed for support which was gradually weaned and pulled His cardiac enzymes peaked on CK MB Trop The patient was aggressively diuresed after developing significant pulmonary edema and his fluid balance was closely monitored given his pre load dependence in setting of RV infarct He had several repeat TTEs during the admission and most recent echo was on Echo showed severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with infer septal inferioa and infero lateral hypokinesis to akinesis a hypokinetic apex mildly dilated RV mild global free wall hypokinesis mod severe MR and a small to moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade Supraventricular tachycardia atrial fibrillation On night of initial presentation

lasting up to min at a time with increasing frequency Per EP recs patient started on amiodarone bolus and drip He continued to have several runs of non sustained V tach and was started on metoprolol tartrate for additional rate control The amiodarone was later stopped but the patient was continued on metoprolol He began having several episodes of a fib flutter on without hemodynamic compromise and his rhythm would spontaneously convert back to normal sinus rhythm He had an episode of symptomatic bradycardia on with ECG telemetry showing retrograde p waves and junctional rhythm rate min The patient was subjectively SOB but not hypoxic and episode was brief No further episodes of symptomatic bradycardia but patient should be closely monitored Of note patient had episode of a fib flutter on for which he received mg metoprolol IV with resultant drop in BP and requiring cc bolus NS His CHADS score is and he will receive aspirin for thromboembolic prophylaxis Systolic heart failure Patient has left ventricular dysfunction likely seconary to his STEMI with an ejection fraction of His heart failure regimen includes metoprolol lisinopril and spironolactone He was initially managed with lasix but was autodiuresing well so his lasix was held on This will need to be restarted as an outpatient to prevent volume overload Hypotension On night of presentation s p cath patient developed atrial tachycardia with ventricular bradycardia and BP s He was started on Dopamine for pressure support and would require ongoing support with several pressors to keep MAP at goal of He was eventually weaned off pressors however his SBPs generally remained in the s s He had some degree of orthostatic hypotension and his anti hypertensive and diuretic regimen were adjusted accordingly Of note patient s SBP persistently in s s in days prior to discharge Patient asymptomatic with SBP in s Respiratory Status Patient sustained multiple facial fractures in the MVA and required intubation for significant airway swelling During his CCU course he was gradually weaned off ventilator support and he was successfully extubated on Sinusitis Fever During early hospital course patient was persistently febrile and diaphoretic In setting of multiple facial fractures he was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage Per ID patient was on regimen of vancomycin aztreonam cipro and metronidazole given penicillin allergy No clear source of infection was initially identified although it was felt that patient may have develoepd sinusitis in setting of facial trauma CT sinus revealed opacification of sinuses however ENT consult did not feel there was any pus abscess or fluid collection ammenable to drainage The patient s antibiotic regimen was tailored back to metronidazole and levofloxacin for a day course He had a PICC placed on The patient was also placed on standing Tylenol during the time of his persistent fevers Prior to discharge the patient was off all antibiotics and remained afebrile He had bottles on blood culture positive for coag negative staph which was felt to be a contaminant Repeat blood cultures were negative Facial fractures Multiple facial fractures noted on CT including the bilateral nasal bones bilateral maxillary sinuses anterior lateral posterior and medial walls the right palatine process of the maxilla and palatine bone bilateral pterygoid plates bilateral frontal processes of the maxillae right lateral orbital wall and right orbital floor Blood was present in the bilateral maxillary sinuses ethmoid air cells sphenoid sinuses and frontal sinuses The globes appeared intact with no evidence of ocular muscle entrapment He was seen by trauma surgery plastic surgery and ophthomology Plastic surgery irrigated and sutured facial lacerations in CCU and ophtho was consulted for periorbital swelling and orbital fx on CT They did not feel there was evidence of entrapment or intraoccular involvement Asymmetric Pupils Left pupil noted to be mm more constricted than the right and neurology was consulted Both left and right pupil would constrict to light Immediate CT scan could not be obtained secondary to patient s hemodynamic instability but CT head once patient medically stable revealed only a small subdural hematoma Ophthomology was Name NI and felt it was highly unlikely any intraocular pathology was contributing to his asymmetric pupils Delirium Agitation Patient developed agitation and delirium later in his hospital course thought to be ICU related delirium He was seen by psychiatry and started on a regimen of olanazpine and mirtazapine He also responsed well to additional olanzapine prn agitation He had some difficulty sleeping and seemed to respond well to trazadone prn insomnia

changes Chest Radiograph FINDINGS Lung volumes are low and there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm There are bilateral infiltrates throughout both lungs central greater than peripheral it is difficult to assess the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes secondary to the low lung volumes and overlying infiltrates There is a left subclavian line with tip in the SVC EEG IMPRESSION This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background This abnormality is suggestive of a widespread encephalopathy of medication metabolic disturbance or infection etiology Of note is the sinus tachycardia There were no lateralized or epileptiform features seen Chest Radiograph IMPRESSION AP chest compared to Consolidation in the perihilar right lung and infrahilar left lung has improved consistent with resolving pneumonia There is no good evidence for edema Heart size is top normal mediastinal vasculature hard to assess pulmonary vessels are minimally engorged No pneumothorax or pleural effusion Trasnthoracic Echocardiogram Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size The interatrial septum is not well visualized suboptimal views Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal The left ventricular cavity size is normal Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal LVEF Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure PCWP mmHg The right ventricular cavity is borderline dilated with normal free wall contractility The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal There is no pericardial effusion Brief Hospital Course year old male with past medical history of mental retardation seizure disorder and DVT who presented with a seizure and mental status changes and was found to have seizure Meningitis The patient presented with a seizure a fever to and altered mental status He was unable to answer questions about localizing symptoms Meningitis was initially suspected due to skin rash though this was more maculopapular than petechial in nature On the first day of his hospitalization he received vancomycin ceftriaxone and acyclovir which would be appropriate empiric treatment of a non specified meningitis encephalitis Unfortunately due to difficulties with obtaining an LP this was not performed until hospital day three and showed pleiocytosis and increased protein but was ultimately culture negative Ultimately this was thought most consistent with partially treated bacterial meningitis Therefore the patient was treated with vancomycin ceftriaxone with resolution of his fevers and improvement of his mental status to baseline without further seizures Acyclovir was stopped when HSV PCR returned negative The patient will ultimately need to complete fourteen days of antibiotic therapy for meningitis Seizure The patient has a previous history of seizures and has been on phenytoin His previous seizures have not been grand mal but this appears to have been the type that occurred on the day of presentation The likely precipitant of this seizure was the patient s infection and fever though phenytoin level was also a bit low Initially he was maintained on IV phenytoin then fospheynytoin but then transitioned back to his outpatient PO regimen as mental status resolved He never showed signs of further seizure activity and EEG obtained to rule out further seizure activity was not consistent with persistent epileptiform activity Allergic Reaction Respiratory Failure The patient had a presentation of rash hypotension and per report swelling of the throat and tongue This could be consistent with acute allergic reaction and the TMP Sulfa he had been given for cellulitis is certainly a potential causative Doctor Last Name Still it seems unlikely he would react suddenly and this remarkably to TMP Sulfa after he had been receiving it for a full day Nevertheless he was treated appropriately for an anaphylactic reaction with epinephrine histamine blocker and steroids and recovered Respiratory failure As stated before it is difficult to tell if the patient actually had anaphylactic shock leading to airway compromise and respiratory failure Other possible etiologies would include pulmonary edema given need for vigorous fluid resuscitation soon after presentation and oversedation in the emergency departments Ultimately the patient was weaned off supplementary oxygen without event Altered mental status Per the patient s mother at baseline he has the mental status of a small child with minimal verbal communication skills but he follows commands and interacts appropriately The patient was initially extremely somonolent and then minimally responsive raising concern for non convulsive status epilepticus EEG was more consistent with encephalopathy however and the patient s mental status eventually resolved to baseline with treatment of his underlying condition and maximization of other variables Likely this was due to toxic metabolic delirium in the context of severe infection History of DVT The patient has a history of two DVT s and thus is presumably on lifelong anticoagulation His INR was initially supratherapeutic so further anticoagulation was held then he was transitioned to low molecular weight heparin for systemic anticoagulation while he was NPO Once he was eating warfarin was restarted and LMWH was stopped after hours of therapeutic INR on coumadin Non sustained ventricular tachycardia On the morning of the patient had two brief runs of NSVT that broke without further management This was discussed with EP who thought barring signs of structural heart disease that this likely had no prognostic significance and was likely simply a response to acute illness The patient had an echocardiogram that was within normal limits and he had no further episodes of VT Of note this also happened while he was being phenytoin loaded which may have contributed to arrythmia FEN The patient initially required tube feeds due to altered mental status and lack of inclination to eat He self discontinued his dobhoff unfortunately and due to a desire to spare another invasive process if possible he was observed and thankfully had cleared enough to tolerate PO in around forty eight hours After that he tolerated a full diet with out incident He tolerated a full diet prior to discharge All vital signs were stable and he was afebrile hours The

Hospital Course yo F with no known medical problems admitted shortness and breath cough Hospital course was notable for admission to the ICU where she was found to have lung and renal abscesses septic shock requiring vasopressor support DVT and PE and difficult to control atrial fibrillation She was also noted to have a large esophageal mass suggestive of esophageal cancer with compression of the left main stem bronchus causing intermittent lung collapse and esophageal compression with dysphagia aspiration Patient had a long ICU course and transferred from the floor to the ICU multiple times Ultimately given the patient s multiple significant and severe medical problems age and progressively declining course despite maximal medical care a discussion was held with the family and the decision was to transition the patient s care to comfort centered care and the patient passed away at AM Septic shock Lung and renal abscesses Patient presented in septic shock from pneumonia with empyema and was found to have lung and renal abscesses She required multiple pressors and intubation Her lactate peaked at CT demonstrated multiple fluid collections as well as an esophageal mass see below that was compressing the L mainstem bronchus that was believed to be predisposing to her polymicrobial infection Interventional pulmonology placed two chest tubes to drain the fluid collections Gram stain showed GPCs GNRs and gram positive rods Cultures only grew strep angionosis She was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics but was weaned down to vancomycin and flagyl per ID recommendations for a planned course of four weeks from the date of her last chest tube placement day one She was weaned off pressors and succesfully extubated She was treated with vanc flagyl until she was made CMO on DVT PE Patient was found to have DVT on lower extremity ultrasound CTA showed small subsegmental RLL PE Patient was placed on heparin gtt After her goals of care discussion anticoagulation was held on Esophageal Mass likely esophageal cancer with bronchial and esophageal obstruction CT showed large mid esophageal soft tissue mass with now complete opacification of the left main bronchus either by invasion hemorrhage and or secretions There was persistent post obstructive left lower lobe consolidation and bronchial secretions and patient did suffer collapse of her left lung It was believed that this mass was the etiology of her polymicrobial septic shock as well as persistent pleural effusions and left sided atelectatsis Secondary to the obstruction of the esophagus and risks for aspiratoin the patient was made NPO She did transiently receive TPN but this was discontinued when care was transitioned to comfort centered care Atrial fibrillation Unclear if patient has history of afib but this was likely exacerbated or caused by infection sepsis There may also have been contribution of irritation by esophageal mass After hypotension resolved patient was managed on the medical floor with IV betablockers but required transfer back to the ICU for rapid atrial fibrillation and low blood pressures in the s She was subsequently rate controlled with IV amiodarone drip in the ICU and transferred back to the medical floor After family discussion regarding overall goals of care amiodarone was eventually discontinued Acute Renal failure Creatinine with unclear baseline Her creatinine later increased to a peak of which was believed to be ATN from septic shock Her creatinine trended back down to On the floor her creatinine remained at baseline Anemia

infarction IMPRESSION No acute intracranial pathological process ADDENDUM AT ATTENDING REVIEW There is marked anterior rotation of the odontoid process relative to a thickened appearance of the body of C The finding likely represents a fracture subluxation deformity There is resultant prominent central canal narrowing at this level There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling at this locale It is possible that the finding represents a prior healed fracture but clearly this question must be resolved through either obtaining prior records imaging studies immediately and or subsequent spinal CT imaging In the meantime the patient s neck needs to be stabilized CT CSPINE COMPARISON CT head from and portable C spine radiograph from TECHNIQUE Helical mm axial MDCT sections were obtained from the skull base through the level of T Sagittal and coronal reformations were obtained and reviewed FINDINGS There is a large mass of new bone formation causing fusion of the C and C vertebral bodies anteriorly with anterior subluxation of C with respect to C b This results in severe encroachment on the spinal canal by the posterior arch of C The degree of subluxation is unchanged from the prior study There is no fracture identified There is extensive fusion of every facet joint from C to T comprising all the levels imaged There is also interbody fusion involving every cervical level There has been surgical anterior fusion at C There is extensive fusion of the lamina and interlaminar ligaments throughout the visualized levels In the portion of thoracic spine included in the study there is fusion of costovertebral and costotransverse articulations Comparison with a torso CT of reveals similar ankylosis in the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints These findings indicate a spondyloarthropathy with manifestations typical of ankylosing spondylitis Correlation with the remainder of her medical history will be helpful IMPRESSION Anterior subluxation of C on C without evidence of fracture The anterior arch of C is fused to the odontoid process via a thick layer of bone that contributes to the subluxation This produces severe encroachment on the spinal canal by the

disease multiple infections including ESBL Klebsiella and osteomyelitis who takes chronic steroids for ankylosis spondylitis presented from an outside hospital intubated and requiring pressors ACTIVE PROBLEMS BY ISSUE Acute metabolic acidosis without respiratory compensation Her pH upon admission to ICU was with a bicarb of later worsened to with bicarb of The possible etiologies of her primary metabolic acidosis include intoxication versus sepsis The active Doctor Last Name s seem to have suppressed her respiratory drive additional respiratory acidosis as well as causing a primary metabolic acidosis She was treated with IV fluids with bicarbonate as well as hyperventilation on mechanical ventilation in order to improve the acidosis and elevated pCO Also the toxicology and psychiatry services were consulted to assist with identifying the cause of her ingestion Finally she was started empirically on piperacillin tazobactam with vancomycin to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia Respiratory failure She was intubated upon arrival but able to be ventilated well including a recruitment procedure to open her atelectatic lung seen on CT She was extubated easily and did well on room air afterwards As discussed above it was thought that she aspirated while she was impaired from an unknown ingestion Her CT chest was consistent with some small bilateral pneumonia Following stabilization and extubation induced sputum results returned positive for MRSA She completed a day course of vancomycin She remained afebrile throughout remainder of course on the medical floor PICC was discontinued prior to Doctor Last Name Hypotension Pt was hypotensive on admission to ICU Her hypotension is of unclear etiology It seems possible that she had sepsis likely from pneumonia Also she may have been down long enough to miss her home florinef dose resulting in hypotension Lastly the ingestion itself could have caused hypotension She was treated with IV fluids antibiotics as above and stress doses of steroids Blood pressures were stable during floor course She was started on captopril when she became hypertensive with subsequent good control Psychologic issues We suspect that she had a purposeful ingestion with suicidal attempt Blood tox was positive for benzos and tricyclics Urine tox was positive for benzos cocaine and opiates However the patient did not admit suicide ideation she intermittently reported that she may have accidentally ingested more medications than intended Psychiatry was consulted and they recommended a sitter She was placed on section She was followed by psychiatry and often refused full interviewing She did not admit to suicide ideation but given her prior suicide attempts and depression with inability to care for herself she was transferred to psych facility for further care All of her psychiatric medications were held during hospital stay She was started on low dose seroquel on the floor prior to transfer to help with sleep Rhabdomyolysis Her admission Creatinine was baseline is with phosphate and CK of Numeric Identifier She was treated with IV fluids and alkalinization of the urine with bicarb Her creatinine improved

hospital and then failed a left subclavian and left IR guided PICC here Imaging looks like there is some type of central obstruction L brachiocephalic vein no flow past it on venogram She was eventually able to get a midline at level of axillary Ultrasound showed left upper extremity DVT She was initially started on heparin gtt with coumadin She was then transitioned to lovenox with coumadin INR was therapeutic for several days between and by time of Numeric Identifier on mg of warfarin daily Pt currently is at risk of falling due to her ankylosing spondylitis and hip dislocations and syncope from substance abuse However given that she will be transferred to an extended care facility it was felt that benefits of anticoagulation would outweigh the risks at this time When ready for Numeric Identifier there should be another discussion of anticoagulation After rehabilitation from both physical and mental viewpoint risks benefits of anticoagulation should be re assessed In the meantime fall precautions should be continued at psych facility Diarrhea Pt had several loose BMs daily C diff was negative x Given amount of diarrhea she was empirically started on oral flagyl mg TID C diff PCR was sent in the meantime PCR returned negative and flagyl was discontinued She was started on immodium with symptomatic relief Tinea corporis Pt had several macular patches on lower back and right leg with central clearing This was consistent with tinea corporis She was treated with clotrimazole cream Hospital Pain control Pt with longstanding history of narcotic use She frequently demanded IV dilaudid for nonspecific complaints including Hospital pain Also has ankylosing spondylitis left hip dislocation and left hand IV infiltration of levophed from OSH that

planned AAA repair had a diverticular bleed and shortly thereafter developed a large PE in his right PA that caused hypoxia and right heart strain He was diagnosed and monitored in the MICU on heparin slowly transitioning from NRB to nasal canula for oxygen He did well and while his right heart strain improved he developed severe complicated c difficile colitis with recalcitrant shock and ventillatory needs that required intubation He ultimately passed on Acute pulmonary embolus bilateral deep venous thromboses patient was admitted to Hospital after transfer from an outside hospital for hypoxia and a V Q scan that illustrated a right lung filling defect After admission noncontrast CT was obtained and showed a large pulmonary embolus in the right lung vasculature Patient was started on a heparin drip with warfarin shortly afterwards IV heparin was stopped hours after therapeutic INR was achieved Bilateral ultrasounds of the lower extremities were performed and showed Upon reaching the medicine floor the patient remained on liters of O by nasal cannula on one occasion requiring a face mask for desaturation below from which he quickly recovered Hypoxia patient was consistently hypoxic during his time on the medical floor with likely contributing factors being his clot burden and underlying emphysema Before being transferred to the medical floor from the ICU the patient was taken off a non rebreather mask and placed on nasal cannula Patient was provided albuterol inhalers and nebulizer treatments as well as ipratropium inhalers around the clock to optimize respiratory status Albuterol treatments were discontinued after the patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation He worked with physical therapy and slowly improved for a period of time from an oxygenation standpoint On patient was noted to be tachypneic to the s low s with oxygen saturations dropping from low s to on liter of O A trigger was called Physical exam showed rales present mostly in the left lung A dose of Lasix was administered due to concern for fluid overload after continuous IV fluid administration due to the patient s elevated creatinine at the time A non rebreather was placed with improvement in oxygen saturations to the mid s and improvement in respiratory rate Patient was given nebulizer treatment and mg IV Lasix ABG was performed with pH pCO pO on liters of oxygen Chest X ray was ordered and showed no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or pneumonia but had signs of worsened atelectasis and pleural effusion as compared to a previous X ray on when the patient first developed a leukocytosis Urine and blood cultures were ordered after the patient spiked a fever to F and the patient was started on IV cefepime and vancomycin empirically He was transferred to the MICU Clostridium difficile colitis on patient began developing numerous episodes of diarrhea along with leukocytosis and testing for Clostridium difficile was ordered A positive result returned on and the patient was begun on PO flagyl for treatment Later on that day it was decided to switch the patient s treatment to IV flagyl as well as PO vancomycin for likely severe C difficile infection Despite antibiotic therapy the patient continued to fare poorly with this infection He went into septic shock On a central line and arterial line were placed for rescusitation Vasopressors were begun Unable to keep up with the work of breathing Mr Known lastname was intubated on the AM of He was transfused one unit of pRBCs to preserve oxygenation but remained on large doses of vasopressors In the early AM of his blood pressure became untenable on neosynephrine and he became increasingly dependent on pressors A CT torso was obtained that showed severe colitis with few other positive findings His family was called to the bedside and he passed at am on Acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease given an equivocal results of FEUrea likely etiology was prerenal failure with progression to acute tubular necrosis Urinalysis was performed and was non revealing The patient s baseline creatinine was Nephrotoxins were avoided and patient s medications were renally dosed Patient was kept at even fluid balance On his creatinine began to rise in conjunction with the numerous episodes of diarrhea that the patient began to experience found to be due to Clostridium difficile infection IV fluids were administered until the time of hypoxia leading to his MICU transfer Urinary retention the patient developed urinary retention during his hospitalization which was thought to possibly be due to the addition of trazodone to help with sleep or from some constipation that the patient developed during his hospital course There was no known history of prostate disease and rectal exam performed on the medical floor revealed no nodularity or enlargement of the prostate and patient was guaiac negative A Foley catheter had to be placed due to urinary retention and trazodone was discontinued but urine retention did not resolve at the time of transfer to the MICU Atrial fibrillation patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation on with possible precipitants being his pulmonary process perhaps mild dehydration and the result of his beta blocker being held Patient was started on metoprolol for rate control which was uptitrated until regular rate was achieved He was already on anticoagulation for his pulmonary embolism and deep venous thromboses The patient was monitored on telemetry throughout the rest of his time on the hospital floor and was

beneath the left hemidiaphragm its distal course not imaged Opacification in the right lower hemithorax suggests a pleural effusion with volume loss including mild rightward shift of mediastinal structures most suggestive of atelectasis An infectious causes is not excluded however The left lung appears clear Although the extreme left costophrenic sulcus is partly excluded there is no evidence for pleural effusion on the left side Allowing for technique the cardiac mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable IMPRESSION Endotracheal tube in a somewhat high lying position approximately cm above the carina If clinically indicated the tube could be advanced by approximately cm Right basilar opacification with volume loss including suspicion for a pleural effusion Head CT FINDINGS There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage mass effect shift of normally midline structures or vascular territorial infarct Doctor Last Name white matter differentiation is preserved throughout The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration No fractures are noted Opacification within the paranasal sinuses is likely related to recent intubation Mastoid air cells are clear IMPRESSION No evidence of acute intracranial process CT Chest FINDINGS The right middle and lower lobe are collapsed Bronchiectasis is mild in the segmental and subsegmental bronchi of the middle lobe and in the subsegmental divisions of the superior and basal segments There is no central bronchial occlusion The constellation suggests that atelectasis may well be chronic There is no indication of pneumonia or pleural or pericardial abnormality A few small bronchi in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe are impacted and there is mild heterogeneity in background density of both upper lobes suggesting small airway obstruction or mild emphysema Mediastinal lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged In the absence of contrast administration I cannot say that there are no enlarged right hilar lymph nodes there are none on the left but even if right hilar nodes are present they are not contributing to the atelectasis because there is no bronchial obstruction Heart is normal size and the study is notable for the virtual absence of atherosclerotic calcification except for small plaques at the bifurcation of the innominate artery ET tube is in standard placement Excretions are pooled above the inflated cuff This study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis except to note there is no adrenal mass A small Bochdalek hernia in the posterior right hemidiaphragm transmits only subphrenic fat IMPRESSION Combination of mild but diffuse bronchiectasis in collapsed right middle and lower lobes In the absence of bronchial obstruction this suggests that the collapse is not acute No evidence of pneumonia Minimal mucoid impaction in small bronchi in the upper lobe Either small airway obstruction or mild emphysema CT C spine FINDINGS Imaged portions of the brain are better visualized on the concurrent head CT Patient is intubated Nasogastric and endotracheal tubes are in appropriate position No evidence of fractures or acute alignment abnormalities No evidence of critical spinal canal stenosis Visualized portions of the lung bases show some scarring in the right upper lobe Left upper lobe is unremarkable IMPRESSION No evidence of fracture CT Abdomen pelvis CT OF THE ABDOMEN At the right lower lung bases consolidative processes with air bronchograms and volume loss including rightward shift No pericardial effusion No pleural effusion The left lung is clear Within the abdomen the evaluation structures is limited without IV contrast however with these limitations in mind the liver is unremarkable The gallbladder has been surgically removed The spleen bilateral kidneys and pancreas are all unremarkable There is some fat stranding of unclear significance around the left adrenal The adrenals themselves are unremarkable An NG tube is seen coursing into the stomach and ending at the pylorus The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable Large bowel is also unremarkable No mesenteric adenopathy is appreciated CT OF THE PELVIS Rectum sigmoid colon bladder and prostate are all unremarkable The patient has a Foley catheter OSSEOUS STRUCTURES The osseous structures are unremarkable No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions IMPRESSION No evidence of acute intra abdominal process Consolidative process in the right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia versus atelectasis sequelae of aspiration could also be considered particularly noting historical circumstances Portable CXR IMPRESSION Interval placement of a right internal jugular central line with its tip in the mid superior vena cava The endotracheal tube has its tip approximately cm above the carina unchanged A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified Patchy and linear opacity at the right base is stable suggestive of patchy and

several day history of increased somnolence initially felt to be due to upper respiratory tract infection anti epilpetic drug uptitration found to have pneumonia and bilateral pulmonary emboli requiring transient ICU admission SOMNOLENCE Community Acquired Pneumonia Per the patient s group home the patient was noted to have lethargy and cough but did not have any increase in his baseline seizure frequency and his neuro exam was unchanged exam for intermittent subtle twitching of the right thumb Chest X ray revealed bilateral lower lobe pneumonia which was felt to be the most likely cause of the patient s somnolence He was treated for community acquired pneumonia with Ceftriaxone and azithromycin and completed his full course of antibiotics in the hospital Epilepsy Patient was maintained on continuous EEG throughout his hospitalization which showed a slow encephalopathic pattern throughout the recording with frequent bursts of rapid generalized epileptiform discharges consistent with patient s diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy as well superimposed toxic metabolic encephalopathy Per his previous titration schedule as specified by Dr First Name STitle his zonegran was discontinued His clobazam was initially uptitrated to mg mg per previous titration level then decreased back to mg mg due to concern that this could be increasing somnolence The rest of his home AED s were continued at their current doses Levetiracetam mg Hospital Lacosamide mg Hospital Depakote ER mg q am mg q pm His somnolence improved with treatment of his underlying pneumonia He was followed by Neurology throughout his hospital course PULMONARY EMBOLI Although the patient was initially satting in mid s on L per nasal cannula on admission while working with physical therapy on he had an acute desaturation which required O by ventimask to maintain O saturation He was transferred to the Medical ICU where his antibiotics were initially broadened to Vanc Zosyn Azithromycin Chest CTA subsequently showed bilateral pulmonary emboli in the distal left main pulmonary artery and bilateral segmental and subsegmental arterial branches A transthoracic echocardiogram was done which showed minimal right heart strain and bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds showed no DVT He was treated with anticoagulation with an IV heparin gtt and transferred to the floor on His O saturation remained in the high s on RA L O by nasal canula After extensive discussion with the Neurology team and the patient s mother and case worker at his group home the decision was made to discharge the patient on a Lovenox bridge to Coumadin Given his frequent seizures and falls it was felt that Coumadin would be a better option given its ability to be reversed should the patient suffer a bleed The interactions of coumadin with the patient s anti epileptic drugs were discussed with the patient s outpatient Neurologist and the decision was made to try to manage anticoagulation with coumadin with lovenox as a second option should the goal INR of be difficult to obtain Patient should continue on anticoagulation for months and will have INR followed and Coumadin titrated by

with EF EKG showed sinus tachycardia Patient was guaiac positive with brown stool in the vault Free calcium was and was aggressively repleted Normal serum glucose was maintained with D and slow D W infusion Hepatology consult assessed that the patient would not be a liver transplant candidate due to her continued heavy ETOH abuse continued illicit IV drug use nonprescribed heavy klonepin and percocet use and previous consistent refusal of medical treatment and recommendations history of signing out against medical advice from hospitals This plan was discussed with her mother father aunt and family who understood and agreed MICU and hepatology team discussed intracranial pressure monitoring using a bolt and it was agreed that no bolt would be placed as patient was not a liver transplant candidate Neurologic exam was performed every hour Her neurologic exam on admission showed pupils constricting briskly to mm on the right and to mm on the left and she was drowsy but oriented to person place year She required a high dose of propofol to maintain proper sedation On when sedation was turned down to test mental status she withdrew appropriately to painful stimuli and pupils were briskly reactive The patient had an episode of vomiting and for concern of airway protection and aspiration she was sedated intubated and LIJ central line and arterial line was placed She was noted to have diffuse ecchymoses over the eyelids behind her ears and on bilateral abdomen thought to be secondary to coagulopathy This elicited concern for a retroperitoneal bleed but since patient was not a candidate for surgical repair at the time and since the patient s clinical status was very tenuous and she was not safe to leave the ICU CT was not performed at this time On AM sedation was turned down to test mental status and she withdrew more slowly to painful stimuli and pupils were still equally reactive Ecchymoses had expanded anteriorly over abdomen but abdomen was soft with bowel sounds and hematocrit was maintained with pRBC transfusions On AM with no change in medications or sedation for the past hour she was noted to have sudden spike of BP and HR s She was given ativan mg IV and labetalol IV and her BP immediately returned to and HR s Neurologic exam was performed and vitals were measured every hour with no change On early afternoon neurologic exam suddenly showed right pupil mm nonreactive and left pupil slow to react to mm Sedation was turned off and patient no longer reacted to painful stimuli Mannitol and CT head chest abdomen pelvis were ordered Within minutes the patient s pupils became fixed and dilated CT head showed uncal transtentorial and tonsillar herniation Neurology reported brain death on Organ bank assessed patient as candidate for heart donation only due to hepatitis C The patient was subsequently given further support for cardiac care for organ donation from to Coagulopathy bleeding Since admission her hematocrit continued to decrease and her INR continued to increase She received a total of pRBC FFP and cryoprecipitate transfusions over days before death INR was initially and was maintained with a goal INR cryoprecipitate was given for fibrinogen RBC transfusion was given for hematocrit or for an acute drop Respiratory insufficiency The patient was hyperventilating with large tidal volumes She was intubated and on AC after an episode of vomiting for airway protection CXR showed bilateral basilar infiltrates concerning for early acute lung injury versus aspiration and patient was started on levofloxacin to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia ETOH opiate withdrawal She was on propofol gtt which controlled withdrawal well On AM she had one episode of BP HR s She was given ativan mg IV and labetalol IV with immediate resolution Renal failure She received several boluses of NS IVF for prerenal azotemia and Cr on admission with no Cr baseline Her renal function worsened and renal was consulted on Urine output was sufficient and she did not require HD or CVVH She was placed on a phosphate binder It was possible that her renal failure occurred in conjunction with liver failure and or was associated with cocaine induced vasoconstriction Hematemesis Patient had small coffee ground gastric fluid and orogastric tube was placed to low suction She was placed on pantoprazole IV BID

Course On Mr Known lastname was admitted to the neuro ICU and started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxsis He remained stable neurologically and radiologically and was cleared for transfer to the floor on Surgery was scheduled for for craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma Preop and consent were obtained He proceeded to the OR on for a right craniotomy for subdural evacuation A JP drain was left in place He remained intubated post op and he went to CT for a scan that showed some acute blood He has left sided weakness He was transfered to the NICU On he was extubated and his strength was slowly improving CT head showed a small amount of acute blood and he was given platelets In total he received units of platelets and his platelet count remained above k A repeat CT head on showed no change when compared to previous scan His subdural drain remained in place and was removed in the late afternoon He was transferred to a step down bed from the SICU that evening The morning of the patient had a repeat Head CT demonstrating no change in right frontoparietal hyperdensity and no new hemorrhage The patient mental status waxed and waned over the course of the day Patient failed speech and swallow and it was recommended to keep the patient NPO NG tube was placed in order to get medications and nutrition On LENIs was obtained to rule out DVT which was essentially negative A repeat Head CT showed slight increase in right Frontoparietal collection As a result a Brain MRI Stroke protocol was obtained as he had not improved neurologically which demonstrated no brainstem hemorrhage MRI head demonstrated the right frontoparietal subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage with mass effect and midline shift which are unchanged as compared to the prior CT scan He was taken to the OR on for a redo right craniotomy for SDH evacuation A post op CT showed improvement with a decreased size of right subdural hematoma with decreased mass effect and a new subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right sylvian fissure and right frontal sulci The patient was taken to SICU B after surgery intubated He remained intubated in the morning with reported seizure activity right arm and right downward gaze fixation treated with increased keppra and continuous EEG The patient was also pan cultured for fever A CT scan was re ordered demonstrating a right frontal infarct Dilantin was added to seizure prophylaxis Vancomycin tobramycin and cefepime were added after Bronch cx returned positive for gram positive rods and cocci and gram negative rods Urine cultures returned positive for Enterococcus The patient remained intubated with no change in neuro exam overnight Patient continued to have febrile temperatures overnight The morning of the patient continued to have seizure episodes Neuroepilepsy was consulted for seizure work up and recommendations endocrine service was consulted for work up of endocrine issues and recommendations and a repeat head CT was ordered Patient was overnight without seizures and afebrile throughout Urine cultures and bronchalveolar lavage cultures returned with antibiotic sensitivities antibiotics were tailored as per sensitivity testing The patient continued to progress in his physical exam with increased movement in his right upper and lower extremit minimal movement of left upper extremity and withdrawal to pain on left lower extremity following commands and opening his eyes to voice The plan was to begin considering possible extubation On the patient continued in the Surgical intensive care unit The ventilator was weaned and the patient was extubated The patient was weak but opened his eyes to voice and was oriented to person place and time The patient was able to move all four extremities antigravity to command The patient moves the left arm and leg after a delay The left side is weakner than the right The patient had a bowel movement On pt was doing well He was AOx and was more interactive with staff and family He was

with history of multiple medical problems including recent right hip infection diastolic dysfunction recent hospitalization with intubation and Type Diabetes Mellitus was admitted with shortness of breath Shortness of Breath Etiology of her shortness of breath is likely multifactorial Differential diagnosis includes congestive heart failure exacerbation related to her recent medication changes and fluid administration pneumonia in the setting of rehab stay recent hospitalization recent intubation and splinting secondary to her chest pain An additional possibility includes pulmonary embolism given her recent hospitalization and immobilization Unfortunately she is not a candidate for a CTA at this time due to her renal failure and VQ scan would likely not be helpful due to her diffuse and patchy infiltrates She was briefly started on heparin gtt on admission Bilateral LENI s were negative on Pulm was consulted and thought CHF most likely and PE unlikely so heparin gtt was stopped vanco zosyn for HAP were started on and continued The pt was diuresed initially on lasix gtt which was transitioned to Hospital lasix prior to transfer At the time of transfer she continues to c o inability to take a deep breath but EKG is without changes and pt has only slight crackles on exam Would recommend pt be kept only slightly negative at OSH as her Cr remains above baseline at Chest Pain Etiology of her chest pain is unclear Differential includes pain related to pneumonia GERD and esophageal irritation s p intubation and NGT placement on prior admission Pt c o odynophagia but has no evidence of aspiration Pericarditis pulmonary embolism or costochondritis were all considered unlikely Her description of her pain is also not consistent with acute coronary syndrome and her ECG is also unremarkable for ACS She was treated for HAP as above and given dilaudid PRN with poor control of her pain at baseline In future GI or ENT could be consulted to evaluate this odynophagia PPI was continued here Fever and Leukocytosis Most likely pneumonia At the time of transfer to the OSH blood and urine cultures remain without growth and rapid viral testing was negative The pt is being continued on vanco zosyn for HAP The pt needs to be on bactrim s p osteo for months but this is on hold while pt on vanco zosyn This should be restarted after current abx finished Acute Renal Failure

dry around the mouth Neck no bruits The heart is regular rate and rhythm Chest Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly The abdomen is obese soft Extremities no edema bilaterally Neurologic examination mental status alert and oriented There is dysarthria although she follows commands and speech is fluent Extraocular movements are impaired Upgaze right more than left She looks to the right and left Right eye did not look laterally Adduction impaired Right pupil millimeters left pupil is millimeters Ptosis in the right eye torsional upbeating nystagmus in primary gaze Right facial weakness Head turning intact bilaterally Shoulder shrug intact bilaterally Decreased sensation in right V through V There is tongue midline but slightly deviated to the left Hearing is intact

Angiocardiolipin antibodies IgG and IgM normal at and respectively Lipoprotein A is high at on Initial magnetic resonance scan of the head showed bilateral pica infarcts also an aneurysm clip causing loss of signal inability to evaluate in distal right internal carotid artery M and A segments Angiogram on showed multiple areas of thrombosis including right vertebral artery thrombosis left pica thrombosis stenosis at the origin of the right anterior inferior cerebellar artery as well as stenosis of the left vertebral artery in both its proximal segment above the level of C vertebral body as well as the level of C vertebral body approximately as well as distal intracranial left vertebral artery stenosis greater than but with a patent basilar artery and collateral flow as described in the results Serial head CT proved stable There is hypoattenuation in the cerebellar cortex consistent with pica infarction bilaterally There is some surrounding edema however no midline shift or evidence of tonsillar herniation There was some distortion of the fourth ventricle and flattening of the quadrigeminal plate cistern which was unchanged as well as a hypodensity in the left basal ganglia consistent with an old infarct There was never any herniation or change in the CT CT of the abdomen and pelvis on showed no evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage This was obtained because of the patient s hematocrit however there was no retroperitoneal hemorrhage There was bilateral mild to moderate atelectasis in the lungs There was no free air and no lymphadenopathy There was a large left sided paraesophageal hernia This hernia required placement of nasogastric tube with the help of interventional radiology initially Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction of left and right atrium normal in size left ventricular wall thickness normal with mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction There is a moderate size thrombus in the left ventricle Left ventricular wall motion abnormalities show at the anterior apex akinetic septal apex akinetic lateral apex akinetic and the apex akinetic Right ventricle and right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion normal Aortic root normal in diameter Aortic valve leaflets mildly thickened no aortic regurgitation Mitral valve showed trivial mitral regurgitation seen There is no pericardial effusion HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was admitted initially transferred and underwent angiogram revealing occluded right vertebral artery and stenosis in the left vertebral artery in addition to her pica infarcts bilaterally Transthoracic echocardiogram showed incidental clot in the heart although the infarcts were thought to be due to artery artery emboli from the vertebrals Hypercoagulable workup was originally sent because initially the clot in the heart was found though likely this clot formed because of the akinetic apex The hypercoagulable workup revealed elevated lipoprotein A This will be repeated this week and will be treated with Niacin should it still be high The patient was started on Heparin on the day of admission especially given this clot in the heart and she was continued on Labetalol drip to control her blood pressure to keep it in the systolic range of to On the day after admission the patient was transiently transferred to the floor however she became agitated She self discontinued her femoral line which was her only access and later had some episode of desaturating to the mid s The repeat head CT showed signs of cerebellar edema but no herniation She was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit She did remain stable in the Intensive Care Unit and was started on Coumadin initially however was requiring frequent suctioning for her sputum Feeding tube was placed and she was started on tube feeds She did become somnolent around the date of however she was found at that time to have a urinary tract infection and was started on Levaquin On was day six of the Levaquin The patient was transfused for her anemia Anemia workup was sent and her stool guaiac was negative Later on that evening she desaturated while being suctioned She had transient respiratory arrest and became very bradycardic Code Blue was called Chest compressions were given for about one minute when the patient became asystolic and the patient was intubated At the time of the code the patient was at her baseline neurologic status and then after intubation she was moving all four extremities Head CT at that time was unchanged Heparin drip was temporarily stopped and a central line was placed The patient was placed on Propofol at that time The following day the patient was taken off the Propofol and she did awaken and was able to follow commands well She was intubated for the next couple of days for stabilization of her respiratory status and was extubated on and did well after that By the frequency of suctioning decreased and the patient was on nasal cannula Her issues neurologically the patient suffered bilateral pica strokes She is on Lipitor for future stroke prevention and also continues on Heparin drip until she has a therapeutic INR on her Coumadin As for the elevated lipoprotein A that will be repeated and then Niacin will be started if it does indeed remain elevated Respiratory wise she has been extubated and is stable status post extubation It is unclear as to whether some of her somnolence may have been due to CO narcosis and so today she has been maintaining oxygen saturation in the low to mid s and has become more awake is doing well on oxygen by nasal cannula Cardiovascularly she is now on Metoprolol Enalapril and p r n Hydralazine for her blood pressure and is off the Labetalol drip Gastrointestinal She has a large hiatal hernia and nasogastric tubes are very difficult to place She will receive a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube tomorrow as she cannot swallow has failed her swallowing evaluation and likely will not be able to swallow for some time Infectious disease She ahs remained afebrile throughout her hospital course She was found to have a urinary tract infection on and is now on day six of the Levaquin This will likely be continued for seven days and stopped Hematologically her hematocrit remained stable Currently she is being transfused for hematocrit less than She has not had any retroperitoneal bleed and no guaiac positive stools Renally she is stable and there are no issues Endocrine wise she does have evidence of diabetes mellitus with a hemoglobin A C of She is on four times a day fingerstick and her regular insulin sliding scale She will need outpatient follow up for this Code Status Her code status has been full code She has improved as far as having no further double vision less vertigo and less dysarthria at this point than on admission She is being currently stabilized for transfer to the floor at some point in the very near future The oncoming Male First

year old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension who was admitted on with sudden onset of vertigo right facial weakness and dysarthria She did have a headache and she endorsed vomiting as well She arrived at a local hospital initially and then was transferred to Hospital for further management Of note the week prior to admission she apparently had one minute episodes of dizziness while watching TV as well as some left leg heaviness She did have pins out of her left arm recently for recent arm fracture and stopped aspirin for some period of time only restarting it on the Monday prior to this admission She was admitted to the ICU here and thought to have nystagmus right Horner s syndrome and right sided facial weakness and numbness An angiogram in the ICU revealed open basilar artery bilateral vertebral artery disease and extracranial right internal carotid artery stenosis She was treated with Heparin drip and required some labetalol drip to control hypertension Her ICU course here was complicated by hypoxia and tachycardia and possible atelectasis She also did develop a pansensitive Klebsiella and Enterococcal UTI Swallowing was greatly compromised and a feeding tube had been planned An echocardiogram did show left ventricular thrombus with poor systolic function due to prior history of CHF On the patient desaturated and had apnea and asystole likely due to inability to tolerate her secretions due to swallow dysfunction She was intubated and eventually was extubated on but still required some suctioning care She was transferred

extremities have full strength and symmetric There were no adventitious movements Sensation appeared intact to light touch pin and joint position in the extremities and the trunk HOSPITAL COURSE The patient as mentioned was initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and then transferred to the floor She had previously been on the Neurology floor briefly for a day before she had difficulty with her secretions At this time while on the floor she continued to have coughing and was able to cough up her secretions but still needed Yankauer suctioning She maintained good oxygenation on nasal cannula and she appeared to do well until when early on the th she had an episode of hypoxia cyanosis with difficulty breathing She was thought to either potentially be not tolerating her secretions versus cardiac heart failure A chest x ray was performed which showed some mild pulmonary vascular congestion and Lasix IV was given to try to alleviate this In addition she was suctioned with

time deep nasotracheal suctioning was helpful and did bring up a lot of mucus secretions The respiratory therapist did note that she had a lot of swelling and difficulty obtaining secretions by suctioning was considered to be due to some of the swelling in the trachea She was transferred to the Neurologic ICU for closer respiratory care The situation was discussed with her son who felt that the patient had clearly stated to the family that the patient would not want resuscitation or intubation should her clinical condition worsen In addition he also reiterated at that time that she would not want a permanent feeding tube A CAT scan was done to ensure that there was no other cause for clinical deterioration besides aspiration and incidentally bilateral occipital strokes were revealed on CAT scan that seemed to be evolving posterior circulation infarct The family was informed of these findings and given that she had more strokes the family felt that she would not want to continue

presented with creatinine of Previously he had been discharged to rehab on n lisinopril and lasix and his creatinine worsened since that time Renal failure was likely multifactorial related to his poor cardiac function prerenal azotemia leading to ATN and complicated by ACE inbitor and lasix use obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy as he was noted to have urine residuals of cc when catheter was inserted and continued periods of hypotension Renal service consulted Despite efforts to closely monitor his fluid status to increase his blood pressure to SBP to maintain renal perfusion to relieve obstruction by placing a foley and to treat his funguria aggressively his creatinine continued to rise Hemodialysis was discussed at length with the patient by both the primary medical and renal teams He fluctuated in his willingness to start dialysis but would not commit to it He developed subtle metabolic acidosis K rose but not above the normal level and he continued to make urine and maintain a euvolemic fluid balance There was no an indication for acute initiation of hemodialysis Creatinine stabilized at around by the time of discharge Funguria the patient had a fever and a

hepatopetal Trace ascites varices and splenomegaly findings consistent with portal hypertension Hypodense lesion within the periphery of the spleen may represent an infarct especially in the setting of clot within the portal venous system However other diagnostic considerations include a focal hematoma in the appropriate clinical setting of trauma Of note there is no flow within thesplenic lesion

color Doppler Left ventricular wall thickness cavity size and regional global systolic function are normal LVEF Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined The prosthetic aortic valve leaflets appear normal There is no aortic valve stenosis No aortic regurgitation is seen The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation There is no mitral valve prolapse The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined There is no pericardial effusion IMPRESSION Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function No significant valvular disease seen Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of PM Sinus rhythm Borderline prolonged upper limits of normal QTc interval Low T wave

is an accessory right renal artery The liver demonstrates increased hypodense material surrounding the vascular structures at the porta hepatis and extending towards the periphery This could represent periportal edema or could indicate periductal soft tissue material At the liver dome there is a suggestion of a mm arterially enhancing focus although this area is obscured by metallic artifact from an object external to the patient A small amount of perihepatic fluid is noted adjacent to the diaphragm The gallbladder demonstrates a markedly thickened hypodense wall with intermediate density intraluminal contents This pronounced gallbladder wall edema is more severe than usually seen in the setting of rapid rehydration Alternatively this could be seen in gallbladder outlet obstruction or

no intrauterine device or vaginal foreign body seen The urinary bladder is collapsed around a Foley catheter with small amount of air There is no free fluid in the pelvis There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy by size criteria OSSEOUS STRUCTURES There is no fracture or worrisome bony lesion IMPRESSION No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality No aortic dissection in the chest or abdomen Small amount of fluid along the superior margin of the liver surrounding the pancreas and gallbladder wall thickening versus edema and likely periportal edema These findings may be due to rapid rehydration but given the phase of imaging other etiologies cannot be ruled out Serum lipase was normal making pancreatitis unlikely This can be further evaluated with a non emergent right upper

hypotensive upon admission to the MICU to SBP in the s however it was unclear what the patients baseline SBP was in addition the patient had been given empiric dose of ativan Per report patient was undergoing bowel prep with Golytley when became acute ill and began vomiting Her hx indicated that she was drinking increased hypotonic fluids including Gatorade The patients urine osms were low at but not maximally dilute also with Na so not retaining maximum Na Thus the etiologies include sodium loss due to a recent change to low salt diet with excessive water replacement while others included adrenocortical insufficiency although increased cortisol in hemolyzed sample and SIADH The patient was initially given hypertonic saline and later changed to normal saline The patient was water restricted and after hrs her mental status cleared to baseline however she did not recall the prior days events The patient was discharged directly from the MICU to home at her baseline mental status

kidney pancreas transplant in and recent STEMI that was medically managed in late who was transferred from OSH with SOB likely PNA and CHF exacerbation Respiratory failure Patient s sats were in the s on RA at OSH CXR showed whiteout c w bilateral patchy PNA CHF exacerbation Following admission patient was initially maintained on BiPAP for what appeared to be increased work of breathing though sats were stable at the time On transfer to Hospital patient failed to improve clinically with diuresis making CHF seem less likely to be the etiology of his respiratory failure Bilateral patchy infiltrate was visualized this atypical pattern for community acquired pneumonia raised concerns for PCP Last Name NamePattern fungal vs multifocal bacterial pneumonia in this chronically immunosuppressed host On HD he was intubated for respiratory distress Diagnostic bronchoscopy and BAL were performed with unrevealing culture data He was initially was treated empirically for PCP Name NameIs Bactrim discontinued due to nephrotoxicity and highly sensitive BAL negative for PCP Name NameIs was treated with a day course of levaquin and vancomycin for broad spectrum coverage as no organism was isolated Serum fungal markers negative for aspergillus equivocal for beta glucan Patient remained ventilator dependent from on CPAP PS with ongoing high ventilatory requirements likely due to fluid overload which was compounded by acute oliguric on chronic renal failure Course was complicated by a MSSA ventilator acquired pneumonia which was treated with days of vancomycin and zosyn Following improvement of renal function we diuresed aggressively with lasix gtt and lasix boluses On he was extubated despite poor prognostic indicators due to the chronicity of his vent dependence with plan for tracheostomy if he did not tolerate non invasive respiratory support He was transitioned to face mask O and ultimately did not require the planned tracheostomy Cardiac a Pump Patient is s p STEMI in with resultant CHF last EF measured at in Month only now this admission On admission the heart failure service was consulted Because his clinical status early in admission did not improve with diuresis we did not feel as though heart failure was the predominant precipitating factor for his initial respiratory failure However his poor pump function and poor renal function compounded his course significantly and led to a protracted course on the ventilator due to worsening pulmonary edema He was tried on a trial of nitroglycerin drip for afterload reduction which was later discontinued in favor of hydralazine His beta blockade therapy was uptitrated as tolerated by BP Throughout the hospital course he was diuresed only as tolerated with careful monitoring of his tenuous renal function b Vessels Per cards persistent troponin elevation was likely residual from prior STEMI as CKMB not elevated Continued medical management with ASA plavix statin BB ACEI held in the setting of ARF c Rhythm Previously NSR with new onset paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during this hospitalization He was initially started on beta blocker for rate control while in the ICU On went into afib without resolution to Lopressor then with dropping blood pressure An amiodarone drip was started with loading bolus of mg with improvement Coumadin initiated on for CVA prophylaxis in this relatively young man with Name NI score of point each for DM HTN and CHF Goal INR There was some difficulty with regulation of his coumadin dosing as the patient became supratherapeutic likely secondary to renal failure His dose was held for a few days and restarted However the patient refused to take the coumadin once reinitiation was recommended because he was concerned about having an elevated INR again Multiple attempts were made to encourage him to take his medications as recommended He was eventually started and discharged on daily oral amiodarone for his irregular rhythm Anemia NG lavage gastroccult positive Stools reported as guiac negative GI consulted on for UGIB and EGD deferred Consider stress ulcer vs OG trauma Iron studies c w anemia of chronic disease He was transfused periodically in the setting of his low output state His hematocrit was stable while on the medicaly floor ARF In the setting of his acute pulmonary illness patient developed acute on chronic renal insufficiency s p renal transplant x years Suspect initially pre renal picture as precipitant for ARF given intravascular volume depletion Renal ultrasound of transplant kidney shows hypoperfusion but no hydronephrosis which was queried in the acute setting of post renal obstruction now resolved Likely overall picture c w prerenal azotemia which resolved throughout the hospitalization with improving Cr and improving UOP The Renal service followed him throughout his stay and felt that he had no acute HD needs despite his poorly functioning renal graft He was continued on Vitamin D analogue Calcitriol for secondary hyperparathyroidism PTH He received Epo units x week for anemia of chronic disease His aAceI in the setting of acute renal failure He was maintained on prednisone and tacrolimus for chronic immunosuppression His tacrolimus dose was decreased under the direction of the Nephrology service Urinary retention Patient also has unusual phallic anatomy with penile implant stricture prostatic enlargement and it is possible that post renal obstruction also contributed to the onset of his ARF Following multiple nursing and house officer attampts at foley placement Urology was consulted and ultimately were able to place a french Coude catheter Had no difficulties with urinary retention once foley discontinued He was restarted on flomax once his hemodynamics were stable and tolerated it well FEN Nutrional support with tube feeds was provided while patient was ventilator dependent A S S evaluation demonatrated possible delayed signs of aspiration A video swallow study was ultimately performed which revealed moderate silent aspiration with nectar thick consistencies and multiple episodes of laryngeal penetration which were able to be cleared with cued cough He underwent a repeat swallow evaluaiton with improved swallowing mechanics His diet was advanced to regular and he tolerated it well While on the medical floor the patient remained stable and was monitored mainly for return of renal function to baseline and medication management It was recommended to the patient initially that he be discharged to a rehabilitation facility for further PT OT However the patient and his wife felt very strongly that he would be safe at home He worked with PT throughout his admission who felt that he was improving

recent seizures C Spine MRI showed similar though decreased region of enhancement in the cervical cord at C The etiology of his his cord pathology is not yet clear Was thought to be neurosarcoid due to presence of pulmonary nodules but no clear evidence of granulomas or elevated ACE was seen Repeat CT of his chest here was normal with no LAD and clear lungs He has been on chronic steroids for several months though so his initial findings may have cleared in this setting In terms of malignancy biopsy of the lung nodules was non diagnostic in the past and the CSF cytology did not contain adequate cells to rule this out as a possible cause Infectious causes seem unlikley but VZV was positive pt never had clinic varicella Had a repeat LP here with essentially normal cell count glucose

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT PRESENTATION On physical examination at presentation to the Intensive Care Unit floor the patient had the following vital signs He was afebrile with a heart rate of blood pressure of a respiratory rate of and he was saturating on room air General appearance The patient was very somnolent but responsive to questions and without tremulousness On examination of the head eyes ears nose and throat the patient was normocephalic atraumatic Mucus membranes were dry Pupils were mm and reactive to light bilaterally The patient s neck was supple without lymphadenopathy On pulmonary examination the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles On cardiovascular examination there was a normal rate and rhythm with normal S S A systolic murmur was appreciated at the apex On abdominal examination normal bowel sounds were present The abdomen was soft non tender and non distended The extremities were without edema or cyanosis On neurological examination the patient was alert and oriented times three Cranial nerves II through XII were intact No focal motor deficits were appreciated PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION The patient had the following laboratories on admission A complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of with an ANC of hematocrit of and a platelet count of Chem hemolyzed showed a sodium of potassium of chloride of bicarbonate of BUN of creatinine of and a glucose of A serum tox screen for aspirin ethanol acetaminophen benzodiazepines barbiturates TCA was negative RADIOLOGY STUDIES AT ADMISSION Electrocardiogram Sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial abnormality Nonspecific ST changes were observed Q prolongation that is new on this EKG was observed compared with previous EKG Chest x ray Mild to moderate cardiac enlargement with prominent left ventricle contour Wide thoracic aorta No evidence of pulmonary congestion or infiltrates Head CT Head CT from Emergency Department visit showed mild focal dilatation with a normal ventricular system No midline shift mass mass effect hemorrhage was observed Chronic paranasal sinus disease was noted IMPRESSION AT ADMISSION This is a year old African American male with a history of polysubstance abuse HIV and hepatitis C who came to the Emergency Department with stuporous mental status changes from detox facility This was felt to be most likely from an opiate overdose as the patient appeared to respond to Narcan while in the Emergency Department Infection as a possible etiology for mental status changes could not be completely ruled out in this HIV positive patient with his last CD count of However the patient does recall taking an extra mg of OxyContin prior to admission on top of his maintenance Methadone dose of mg per day and benzodiazepine taper that he had been started on after his Emergency Department visit making overdose more likely HOSPITAL COURSE IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT Unit Number Neurological Patient s mental status changes which included increased lethargy to stuporousness pinpoint pupils and decreased respiratory rate in the setting of Methadone benzodiazepine and opiate use make opiate overdose the most likely cause of this patient s presentation The patient showed good response to naloxone throughout his stay in the Intensive Care Unit which was continued as a drip until with dramatic improvement in the patient s state of alertness Other causes for his change in mental status included withdrawal from benzodiazepines and alcohol electrolyte abnormalities infection intracranial processes as well as renal hepatic disease For that reason electrolytes were followed calcium magnesium phosphate levels were sent An LP was also performed The patient was pan cultured including cultures for blood urine and cerebrospinal fluid Because of the patient s history of alcohol and benzodiazepine use with the last alcohol use likely on there was a possibility of withdrawal in this patient so a CIWA protocol with diazepam q h for a score greater than Clonidine p r n was also continued for the possibility of developing opiate withdrawal In this patient with depression his Prozac was held while he was in the Intensive Care Unit A Neurology consult felt that the seizure on was most likely secondary to a combination of withdrawal from both alcohol and benzodiazepines As recent cocaine was evident in the urine tox screen there was some concern of a cerebral infarct but a negative CT and nonfocal neuro examination made this less likely Liver function tests and ammonia were also sent in this patient with a history of hepatitis C Patient s laboratory values while in the Intensive Care Unit on included a calcium of magnesium of and a phosphate of The patient s PT was INR was and PTT was The patient had an elevated AST of an ALT of an alkaline phosphatase of and a total bilirubin of His albumin was and was repeated that same day and found to be Amylase was and lipase was The patient had an ammonia elevated to with no history of previous baseline ammonia recorded in the past A urine tox screen was positive for cocaine and Methadone and negative for benzodiazepines An LP was performed on which showed white blood cells red blood cells a protein of and a glucose of The Gram stain was negative for PMNs no microorganisms were seen Cryptococcal antigen was not detected and fluid acid fast viral and fungal cultures were sent Infectious Disease This patient is HIV positive and hepatitis C positive and it is possible that infection could also be an underlying cause of his mental status changes As mentioned he was pan cultured including blood urine CSF and stool cultures Tests for CD count and viral load were sent The patient reported that he has not been on retrovirals since the fall of last year Liver function tests were ordered to follow up the status of his cirrhosis and were elevated as previously mentioned in this dictation Throughout the patient s duration in the Intensive Care Unit he did not complain of fevers shortness of breath or productive cough dysuria or other complaints suggestive of infectious process Pulmonary The patient s respiratory rate improved on Narcan drip while in the Intensive Care Unit and there was no need to intubate Cardiac The patient has a history of hypertension and has used beta blockers in the past He has not been on his hypertensive medication during the past several days while at detox His pressures remained elevated while in the Intensive Care Unit In the evening of he was hypertensive to and was given a dose of hydralazine for control of his pressure Subsequently lisinopril mg q day and hydrochlorothiazide mg q day were begun to better control his pressure The patient s EKG showed an increased QT prolongation from prior EKG in the setting of a potassium of upon repeat Chem on It was unclear that any of the other medicines that the patient were taking should be associated with causing this QT prolongation The patient s potassium was repleted Hematology The patient s pan cytopenia was noted on CBC This was stable throughout his stay in the Intensive Care Unit Renal Fluids Electrolytes and Nutrition The patient was given maintenance fluids of one half normal saline cc per hour These were maintained until the patient s mental status improved He began tolerating p o s on Because of the patient s elevated ammonia he was placed on a low protein diet once he was able to tolerate p o s Electrolytes were followed daily and were repleted as necessary with potassium and magnesium requiring repletion The patient was placed on thiamine folate and a multivitamin considering the patient s history of alcohol abuse Gastrointestinal The patient has a history of cirrhosis in the setting of HAART use that was discontinued in with a history of ethanol abuse He has had elevated transaminases PT and albumin of and elevated ammonia Lactulose was started at cc t i d titrated to less than two stools per day to treat the elevated ammonia Hepatitis C serologies were not sent at this time and will likely be followed as an outpatient Prophylaxis The patient was placed on subcu heparin and Pepcid IV q day SUMMARY OF INTENSIVE CARE UNIT STAY The patient s mental status continued to improve on Narcan drip which was weaned over hours to a respiratory rate greater than Cultures remained negative during the ICU stay The patient was able to tolerate p o s prior to transfer Vital signs were stable although his blood pressures remained elevated prior to transfer The patient was transferred to the Hospital Ward Name Company Service on HOSPITAL COURSE ON THE FLOOR to Neurological On arrival to the floor the patient was breathing comfortably in no acute distress and was alert and oriented with some depressed mood He did complain of some symptoms of nausea chills diaphoresis aches and pains diarrhea that he thought were consistent with his typical withdrawal symptoms He was continued on the CIWA protocol with p r n diazepam and clonidine was continued for his complaints of opiate withdrawal His Methadone was begun on the floor at a dose of mg q day Lactulose was also considered in light of his elevated ammonia although encephalopathy appeared to be unlikely in this patient with no asterixis or additional changes in mental status We continued to follow daily labs which showed a white blood cell count of hematocrit of and a platelet count of with an ANC of Electrolytes showed a sodium of potassium chloride bicarbonate BUN creatinine and glucose Calcium was magnesium and phosphate was While the PT and INR were now normal PTT remained slightly elevated at The patient was offered a nicotine patch for his nicotine addiction which he declined The patient s mental status continued to be stable during his stay on the floor with no signs of overt anxiety hallucinations instability but the patient was somewhat depressed and nervous which he admitted was primarily due to his worry about personal stressors His symptoms of opiate withdrawal were also negligible during his second and third days on the floor Prozac was restarted on his last day of admission for depression It appeared that the patient had very few symptoms of ethanol withdrawal however his blood pressure did remain elevated throughout his stay but without tachycardia The patient s symptoms of opiate withdrawal seemed to be well controlled on his Methadone maintenance dose although the patient did receive one to two doses of benzodiazepine per day and requested clonidine on his final day of admission p r n However the patient does admit that he feels better than he has in years physically but admits that it is psychological problems and depression that make him feel most concerned at this time We had several discussions with the patient regarding the seriousness of this hospital admission and the risk of poor outcome if he continues such risky behaviors as this overdose might have been life threatening The patient is actually quite thoughtful and clearly depressed with his current health situation living environment my neighborhood is full of drugs and life stressors several deaths in the recent past in his family Infectious Disease The patient s CD count was found to be during this admission and his viral load is still pending The patient remained afebrile throughout his admission without complaints of fever productive cough dysuria abdominal pain or other clinical signs concerning for infection Blood stool and cerebrospinal fluid cultures have been negative to date Prophylaxis was begun for PCP with dapsone and fluconazole was also started in this patient with a history of thrush However fluconazole was discontinued prior to __________ as prophylaxis is not indicated routinely in HIV positive patients As the patient s CD count is below toxoplasmosis titers were also sent and should be followed up for possible toxoplasmosis prophylaxis as well as Doctor First Name prophylaxis as an outpatient Cardiovascular The patient s EKG was repeated on and was found to be unchanged from admission EKG with suddenly prolonged QT interval Potassium was also on and was repleted The patient s blood pressure continued to be elevated throughout his stay on the floor in the s to s over s to s The dose of lisinopril was increased to q day and it was decided prior to discharge to change the patient s blood pressure regimen to mg lisinopril b i d to discontinue the hydrochlorothiazide and to begin Norvasc mg p o q day Pulmonary The patient was breathing comfortably with normal respiratory rate and saturating well on room air throughout his stay on the floor While the patient complained of some runny nose on transfer to the floor he developed no other symptoms suggestive of a serious respiratory infection This patient does have previous hospitalizations because of pneumonia with a question of PCP pneumonia in the past Renal The patient had normal creatinine throughout his hospital stay His urinalysis was negative except for a negative urobilinogen in this patient with advanced liver disease Urine culture was positive for group B Strep which was an endogenous organism not considered needing to be treated Fluids Electrolytes and Nutrition The patient s lytes were followed and were repleted while he was on the floor Potassium remained slightly low throughout and was repleted with mEq of KCl during each of his stays on the floor and was increased to mEq on He was maintained on a low protein diet in light of his elevated ammonia which was up to on his day of discharge He was continued on thiamine folate and multivitamin and additional B and folate studies were sent and are still pending He tolerated p o liquids and solids well throughout his stay on the floor No complaints of nausea or vomiting Gastrointestinal In this patient with hepatitis C positive cirrhosis his albumin came back at on We continued to follow an ammonia which was prior to discharge and lactulose was poorly tolerated by the patient and was discontinued on his final day of admission The patient was requesting therapy options for his liver disease and seemed most concern with this of his health issues Unfortunately Interferon therapy may be contraindicated in this patient on Zoloft with clear symptoms of depression As an outpatient it would be recommended that he receive vaccination such as hepatitis A in light of his liver disease While this patient has no prior history of gastrointestinal bleed we began Imdur for GI prophylaxis and it is recommended that he have an esophagogastroduodenoscopy as an outpatient Hematology The patient s pan cytopenia was stable while on the floor The patient did complain of a nose bleed one morning in the setting of low platelet count that he described as robust but which stopped easily and did not recur In light of the patient s pan cytopenia which may be likely due to ethanol use HIV liver disease it was thought that B and folate should also be checked Prophylaxis The patient remained on heparin subcu b i d and ranitidine mg p o b i d throughout his stay on the floor CONDITION AT DISCHARGE The patient was in good condition at discharge He was not complaining of symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and was maintained on CIWA protocol greater than during his last three days on the floor Methadone maintenance was restarted with good effect He was primarily concerned with psychosocial issues of maintaining sobriety a safe drug free environment his chronic health issues family stressors and tomorrow s pending court appearance Depression for these reasons is a concern in this patient who appears to have overdosed on narcotics leading to this admission DISCHARGE STATUS The patient was discharged back to Hospital Hospital where he was first admitted last Monday to begin a detox program prior to this hospitalization He wishes to return to Bornwood to continue his detox in a safe environment where he can try to address his recurrent urges for polydrug abuse Hospital Hospital is

him with Dr First Name NamePattern Name STitle at First Name NamePattern Last Name NamePattern Associates Hospital for this Thursday at p m the Hospital Ward Name Building At this appointment the patient will be able to follow up his pending laboratory studies which include pending cultures his viral load his toxoplasmosis cultures Also potassium and ammonia levels should be checked at this time As the patient s blood pressures have been elevated during his hospital stay and his blood pressure control medications are still being optimized his blood pressure should be checked during this visit and modification of his medical regimen should be considered Pending results of the toxoplasmosis titers the patient should be considered for a toxo and Doctor First Name prophylaxis considering his CD count of Also consider a hepatitis A vaccine and confirm hepatitis B status in this patient As this patient was noted to have a slightly prolonged QT interval on EKG it would also be useful to recheck an EKG during this visit While this patient has had no complaints of gastrointestinal bleed in the past he should be sent for endoscopy to look for varices as an outpatient The patient has also been requesting psychiatric and or social work support as he has numerous psychosocial stressors and needs a support network to help him with his depression and with the numerous issues involving his drug abuse and health care problems This patient should also be set up to be followed in the Hospital The patient was also scheduled to visit the Pain Clinic at Hospital this Thursday with Dr Last Name STitle on at p m This visit is important in light of his chronic back pain and peripheral neuropathy which the patient states have been a factor in his persistent drug use Continue with Methadone

aspirin allergy Plavix was started Renal failure Likely in the setting of blood loss and hypertension SCr at the time of discharge after peaking to on admission Mental status change After arriving to the floor the patient would become mildy agitated at night and would also become disoriented This was felt to be secondary to narcotics provided earlier in her stay Her pain regimen was changed with the hope to minimize narcotics use Tylenol RTC was given and a Lidocaine patch was applied to her left flank Low doses of oxycodone IR and Ultram were used Geriatrics was consulted and recommended low dose of Hospital Haldol and re institution of Klonopin given that the patient presented on chronic benzoes This worked well and the patient improved greatly with no issues over the final days of her

Brief Hospital Course Ms Known lastname is year old pleasant woman with a Past medical history significant for MDS with AML transformation on Dacogen diverticulosis known cecal AVMs admitted from clinic on in the setting of a transfusion reaction to platelets with thrombocytopenia who was noted to develop bright red blood per rectum with acute hematocrit drop who underwent repeat colonoscopy showing non bleeding diverticulosis of the entire colon and bleeding angioectasias of the cecum treated with Argon Plasma coagulation She required a second colonoscopy for repeated bloody bowel movements which showed a clot adherent to the cecum She remained stable for a while then had frequent bloody bowel movements again which was controlled by amicar drip for hours Gradually her platelets started to increase After these events she remained stable and was discharged home in stable condition She will require HLA matched platelet transfusions in the future if needed cecal AVMs She was transferred to the ICU twice for bright red blood per rectum The patient developed BRBPR and was found to have cecal AVMs on colonoscopy s p APC Specifically repeat colonoscopy demonstrated cecal angioectasias that were actively bleeding non bleeding colonic diverticula and small polyp Hemostasis achieved with Argon Plasma coagulation therapy on During her stay she required several units of PRBC and platelets After remaining stable she was transferred back to the floor however she had the same situation again and was transferred back to the ICU where she had her second colonoscopy which showed a clot adherent to the cecum with oozing around the clot The clot was not removed not amenable to endoscopic management GI recommended surgical consult for possible resection however given her underlying disease and low platelet counts they felt this will not be a favorable management After having stable H H she was transferred back to the floor While on the floor she had a few bloody bowel movements however the night of she had total of cc bloody watery stools which required amicar drip for hours her platelets were in the s CTA was negative Following this she did not have any further significant bloody stools She remained vitally stable with stable H H and gradually rising platelet count thrombocytopenia Secondary to chemotherapy and MDS AML concerns Concern for consumptive process following transfusion of platelets in the setting of possible ITP vs TTP however Hematologic smear was without schistocytes and there was no evidence of renal failure or neurologic concerns no fevers The patient also had two transfusion reactions to platelets when first admitted She was premedicated with anti histamines While the patient was actively bleeding she was also given Amicar grams IV with gram hour IV infusion overnight on This was repeated over the night of as above She was found to have a positive PRA and required HLA matched platelets for all subsequent transfusions Her twin sister was tested at Red Cross for potential candidate to donate platelets for her sister however since she takes aspirin and plavix this was not a suitable option Of note her platelet count was improving already and did not require further platelet transfusions Platelet count was in the s upon discharge transfusion reaction PRA positive The patient had transfusion reaction to platelet transfusion once in clinic and once while on the floor She was premedicated with famotidine benadryl and hydrocortisone A blood bank work up was initiated and the patient was given group specific platelets She was found to be PRA positive and requires HLA matched platelets However during her second episode of BRBPR on it was found that there was no more HLA matched platelets available in Location un area Red Cross was contact Name NI for more HLA matched platelets Sister was a potential donor however it wasn t suitable given her anti platelet therapy as above She did not require further platelet transfusions once her platelet count started to increase MDS with AML transformation While the patient was on the floor it was noticed that her blast count was trending up and her neutrophil count was trending down It was then decided to start her on second cycle of Dacogen day The patient tolerated the Dacogen well with little side effects blast cells on peripheral blood upon discharge GERD The patient was continued on her home PPI constipation The patient has a history of severe constipation however her home medications were held in the setting of her BRBPR and then restarted upon discharge given resolution of bloody bowel movements Transitional Issues The patient had transfusion reaction to platelets a blood bank work up was initiated and she was found to be PRA

some areas of bleeding called AV malformations that were clipped After this you were sent to the floor then sent back to the ICU when you had further bleeding Second colonoscopy was done which showed a large clot attached to your colon in the same area where the AVM s were clipped Your blood level was stable as well as your blood pressure and you were transferred to the floor While on the floor you had a few loose bloody stools that subsequently resolved Your diet was gradually advanced and you tolerated it well prior to discharge Your platelets gradually increased and it was in the s on your discharge day The surgeons evaluated you for possible surgical removal of part of your colon however they felt it is unsafe to do surgery for the moment We did not discharge you on Amicar which is a clot stabilizer medication since you did not have further bloody stools your blood level was stable and your platelets were gradually increasing We also noticed some changes in your blood work that made us think that your leukemia was acting up again because of that we started you on another five day cycle of chemotherapy You tolerated the chemo well While in the hosiptal it was noted that occasionally your blood pressure was high and you were started on a medication for brief time However given your GI bleeds this was held We will not discharge you at the moment with anti hypertensive medication We did the following changes in your medication list Please stop allopurinol Please continue the rest of your home medications the same way you were taking them at home prior to admission

of multiple possible sources was begun with vancomycin levofloxacin and metronidazole She was aggressively fluid resuscitated A norepinephrine drip was required to maintain blood pressure in adequate range Urine culture was positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae and the patient also had stool positive for C diff toxin Vancomyin was discontinued after osteomyelitis was ruled out as a possible infection in this patient The patient s blood pressure was stable and the norepinephrine drip was discontinued She was transferred to R on the am of On arrival to the floor her temp was hr bp ID On the floors she completed day courses of both flagyl and meropenem and remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of her hospital course Leg Ulcers The patient was seen by vascular surgery who felt that her ulcers were a combination of venous stasis and pressure ulcers ABIs were not done as it would cause the patient too much pain and the patient was not felt to be a surgical candidate regardless in light of her condition and comorbidities Her dressings were changed once a day however this was causing her extreme pain despite morphine and ativan premedication and dressing changes were decreased to every three days and then not at all She should not have any further dressing changes as the pain is excrutiating for her Anasarca fluid balance hypernatremia Ms Known lastname was found to be intravascularly depleted high sodium but total body fluid overloaded We attempted diuresis but this only elevated her sodium We therefore fluid resuscitated her to lower her sodium and then began diuresis once her hypernatremia had resolved We had hoped that her fluid balance would improve with initiation of TPN to raise her albumin however after a week of TPN her albumin continues to decrease and she is not eating anything Her anasarca persists She will get maintenance IVF at Hospital with D in the absence of other forms of nutrition Nutrition TPN was initiated through her central line on Her albumin was on declining to on She occasionally ate spoonfulls of pudding however largely refused food and PO medications Anemia The patient had a baseline hct ranging

controlled with digoxin in the unit and not responsive to amiodarone On the floors her rate was well controlled in the s though her pulse was irregularly irregular She was therefore maintained on digoxin and coumadin for anticoagulation Her coumadin was maintained at mg qhs and INR was therapeutic for the most part Mental status The patient had waxing and Doctor Last Name mental status but

Hospital REPORTS LABS EKG Atrial fibrillation Low voltage throughout Non specific T wave abnormality in the lateral leads Abnormal tracing No previous tracing available for comparison CXR FINDINGS Cardiac silhouette is enlarged Prominence of right cardiac border could reflect enlarged right sided cardiac Doctor Last Name or adjacent pericardial abnormality such as a pericardial cyst or prominent fat pad Attention to this on standard PA and lateral chest radiograph is recommended when the patient s condition permits No focal areas of consolidation are present within the lungs Questionable small pleural effusions which could also be more fully address by standard PA and lateral chest radiographs EKG Atrial fibrillation Low voltage throughout Abnormal tracing Compared to the previous tracing ST segment abnormalities are resolved TRACING ECHO Hospital The left atrium is moderately dilated The right atrium is markedly dilated A patent foramen ovale is present There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional global systolic function LVEF The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis The ascending aorta is mildly dilated The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened There is no mitral valve prolapse An eccentric jet of moderate to severe mitral regurgitation is seen The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened Severe tricuspid regurgitation is seen There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure There is no pericardial effusion IMPRESSION Moderately dilated right ventricle with mild systolic dysfunction Normal global and regional left ventricular systolic function Severe tricuspid regurgitation Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation At least mild pulmonary hypertension CXR IMPRESSION No acute intrathoracic process LENI IMPRESSION No evidence of DVT in the right or left lower extremities VQ SCAN INTERPRETATION Ventilation images obtained with Tc Age over m aerosol in views demonstrate some accumulation of tracer in the large airways Matched defects in the right lung base is likely due to pleural effusion Perfusion images in the same views show mismatched segmental defects in the right upper lobe and superior segment of the right lower lobe Chest x ray shows a small right pleural effusion and cardiomegaly The above findings are consistent with a high likelihood ratio for pulmonary embolism IMPRESSION High likelihood ratio of pulmonary embolism in the right upper lobe Renal u s Limited study showing no evidence of hydronephrosis and no direct evidence of venous clot Suggested reversal of diastaolic flow in the left renal artery The significance of this is unclear given the limitations noted and may be related to a high resistance system including acute tubular necrosis or might be artifactual If vascular thrombus is still of concern noncontrast MRV of the renal veins may be of use to confirm patency Small bilateral kidneys consistent with chronic medical renal disease EKG Significant baseline artifact precludes an accurate interpretation of the rhythm No clear P waves are seen suggesting possible atrial fibrillation Poor R wave progression in leads V V of unclear significance No other interpretation is possible based on this tracing Compared to the previous tracing of atrial fibrillation is likely still present EKG FINDINGS Since mild right pleural effusion and mild to moderate right basilar atelectasis is worse Mildly enlarged heart size is stable and a suspicion for pericardial effusion was raised Findings were discussed with Dr First Name NamePattern Last Name NamePattern who mentioned regarding recent echocardiogrpaphy which revealed sever cardiomegaly secondary to multivalvular involvement but no pericardial effusion Aorta is generally larger however there is no evidence of a focal aneurysm There is no evidence of pulmonary edema CXR FINDINGS In comparison with the study of there is further

gasric antral vascular ectasias admitted with hypoxemia following endoscopic banding of her gastric AVMs Hypoxemia Acute vs chronic pulmonary embolism Chronic diastolic heart failure with secondary pulmonary hypertension Etiology of acute onset worsening hypoxemia on admission was initially not obvious Physical exam was consistent with volume overload but exam was complicated by tricuspid regurgitation and v waves to the jaw Aspiration was considered but absence of significant lung pathology on exam or chest X ray made this less likely A V Q scan was performed and was read as having high probability for PE in the right upper lobe Additionally an echocardiogram was notable for preserved EF but with mod severe mitral regurgitation right ventricular dilatation and reduced systolic function with severe tricuspid regurgitation and the presence of a PFO No valsalva or agitated saline contrast maneuvers were performed These echo findings were similar to echo in Given her multiple contraindications for anticoagulation including history of requiring blood transfusions every days for her gastric AVMs transfusion dependance and recurrent GI bleeds anticoagulation was not pursued Additionally bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds were negative for DVT so an IVC filter was not placed Despite lack of intervention the patient improved slowly with reduced oxygen requirement with re initiation of diuretic regimen The risks and benefits of anticoagulation and the current clinical dilemma were discussed with the patient and the patient s PCP Last Name NamePattern and pt s son Name NI Name NI on In addition pt was given unit of PRBCs during admission However should the patient get to a place where she may only require monthly transfusion or should she develop chest pain hypotension tachycardia increasing hypoxia etc the risk benefit ratio of anticoagulation for PE may change to favor anticoagulation In addition the patient also did not show signs of a hemodynamically significant PE She did have periods of relative hypotension during times of afib with RVR Pt carries a diagnosis of afib prior to admission and her BP was improved predictably with better HR control In addition there was question of the acute vs chronic PE The echo findings appear to be present in and could be explained by her valvular disease Pt had sats of on RA ambulatory sats on RA However pt did experience occasional noctural hypoxia to on RA and was therefore sent home with home oxygen at L nightly for now Troponins x BNP during admission Oxygenation much improved during admission VNA

There is a round hypodense area in the left frontal lobe that is unchanged compared to the prior study and most likely represents an old lacune The paranasal sinuses are normally aerated IMPRESSION Stable appearance of the brain No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage Brief Hospital Course CHF etiology likely inadequate afterload reduction no ACE inhibitor and low dose lasix Possible EF significantly lower than pre CABG LV gram indicated He diuresed well with nesiritide gtt accompanied by boluses of Lasix responded to lasix mg IV He was able to be extubated on after considerable diuresis He also had a thoracentesis pleural fluid c w transudate which was complicated by a pneumothorax on the right Thoracic surgery placed a chest tube which was able to be discontinued days later ptx resolved His medical management was optimized His ACE inhibitor was titrated up along with his metoprolol to mg TID and he still had relatively poor bp control in the s to s Aldactone was added He was placed on standing lasix Hospital which was decreased to once a day as well as ASA and a statin Hypoxemia likely all due to CHF but question of infiltrate on initial CXR His sputum grew GNR but culture negative He was originally placed on vanc zosyn but was changed to levaquin for total day course He remained afebrile His oxygen saturation improved greatly with diuresis Afib labled chronic His coumadin was originally held and he was placed on a heparin gtt This was discontinued when he had the chest tube placed His coumadin was restarted when the tube was pulled and he was not bridged with heparin given the risk of bleeding His INR was supratherapeutic upon discharge and his INR should be checked by his visiting nurse the day after discharge Metabolic Alkalosis likely contraction from diuresis Improved with diamox although not resolved Question if pt has hyperaldo hypernatremia hypokalemia and difficult to treat hypertension However he would need to have all his diuretics stop to appropriately diagnose this and that isn t feasible at this time Psych He was intermittently confused and agitated throughout his course He was originally kept on his outpatient regimen of seroquel qhs and zyprexa tid He was evaluated by psychiatry who recommended a delirium workup His head CT was neg as was his TSH Psychiatry recommended discontinuing the zyprexa and seroquel and instead recommended standing haldol TID and Hospital prn for agitation At times the patient exhibited extreme behavior by verbally attacking his nurses and physicians Gout He developed an erythematous painful R MTP joint which was treated wiht prednisone mg po qd x d Because of his altered mental status which became acutely worse the same day the steroids were started he only had days of prednisone His toe pain resolved and the steroids were discontinued steroid psychosis Hematuria Foley catheter was placed last admission in This was placed by urology with cystoscopy and ureteral dilation secondary to anatomical difficulty from BPH Foley was removed this admission as it had been in place for three months Due to urinary incontinence and skin breakdown from fungal infection the catheter was replaced by urology It should be removed once skin condition improves Clostridium Difficile Colitis Patient had been started on oral vancomycin for clostridium difficile colitis diagnosed at Hospital Rehabilitation Center Presumably he was started on vancomycin since had previously been treated Date range for C difficile colitis with Flagyl and this was assumed to be a relapse He completed his course on however continued to have diarrhea with positive C diff toxin Therefore the vancomycin was restarted on with plan for days to complete Flagyl was added for a ten day course to Placement Many discussions with the family were made The patient s wife felt that he had suffered emotionally and physically in a rehab hospital where he recently stayed and refused to place him in another rehab hospital Instead she felt that the patient was nearing the end of his life and preferred him to be home for his quality of life and happiness All those actively involved in Mr Known lastname care including nurses doctors and case managers advised his wife that caring for Mr Known lastname required a high degree of nursing care and were strongly against sending the patient home as he appeared medically unfit However Mrs Known lastname insisted on taking him home As a result case management was involved in setting up home VNA and maximal medical services available In addition the wife met on several occasions with the nursing staff to care for her husband under nursing supervision and guidance days before discharge As the patient is at risk for aspiration and thus must remain strictly
